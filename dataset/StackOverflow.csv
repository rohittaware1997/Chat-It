Should I use nested classes in this case?,"I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure. My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem. I would reference something like a QTextDocument in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation. ",c++
How do I connect to a database and loop over a recordset in C#?,"Very roughly and from memory since I don't have code on this laptop: using (OleDBConnection conn = new OleDbConnection()) {   conn.ConnectionString = ""Whatever connection string"";   using (OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand())   {     cmd.Connection = conn;     cmd.CommandText = ""Select * from CoolTable"";     using (OleDbDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())     {       while (dr.Read())       {         // do something like Console.WriteLine(dr[""column name""] as String);       }     }   } } ",c#
"How to get the value of built, encoded ViewState?","Rex, I suspect a good place to start looking is solutions that compress the ViewState -- they're grabbing ViewState on the server before it's sent down to the client and gzipping it.

How do I delete a file which is locked by another process in C#?,"You can use this program, Handle, to find which process has the lock on your file. It's a command-line tool, so I guess you use the output from that... I'm not sure about finding it programmatically. If deleting the file can wait, you could specify it for deletion when your computer next starts up: Start REGEDT32 (W2K) or REGEDIT (WXP) and navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager W2K and WXP W2K:EditAdd Value...Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZValue Name: PendingFileRenameOperationsOK WXP:EditNewMulti-String Valueenter PendingFileRenameOperations In the Data area, enter ""\??\"" + filename to be deleted.

.NET Unit Testing packages?,"I like MbUnit, er, Gallio.  Most importantly to me is having good tools support inside Visual Studio.  For that I use Resharper, which has an MbUnit test runner.  A lot of folks seem to like TestDriven.NET as their test runner as well.",c#
How do you disable browser Autocomplete on web form field / input tag?,"Firefox 30 ignores autocomplete=""off"" for passwords, opting to prompt the user instead whether the password should be stored on the client. Note the following commentary from May 5, 2014:      The password manager always prompts if it wants to save a password. Passwords are not saved without permission from the user.   We are the third browser to implement this change, after IE and Chrome.    According to Mozilla developer documentation the form element attribute autocomplete prevents form data from being cached in older browsers. &lt;input type=""text"" name=""foo"" autocomplete=""off"" /&gt; ",html

How can I create Prototype Methods (like JavaScript) in C#.Net?,"You need to create an extension method, which requires .NET 3.5. The method needs to be static, in a static class.

"How can I Java webstart multiple, dependent, native libraries?","I'm not sure if this would be handled exactly the same way for webstart, but we ran into this situation in a desktop application when dealing with a set of native libraries (dlls in our case). Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure  If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work.",java
"Is a ""Confirm Email"" input good practice when user changes email address?","I agree with you in that it is quite an annoyance to me (I also copy and paste my address into the second input). That being said, for less savvy users, it is probably a good idea. Watching my mother type is affirmation that many users do not look at the screen when they type (when she's using her laptop she resembles Linus from Peanuts when he's playing the piano).  If it's important for you to have the user's correct email address then I would say having a confirmation input is a very good idea (one of these days I'll probably type my email address wrong in the first box and paste it wrong into the second box and then feel like a complete idiot).",html
How to wait for thread complete before continuing?,"If I'm reading this properly, you're starting work items on bunch of threads but you're concerned that the threads are completing out of order, and, would prefer to wait until each thread completes in the order they were started ?

Some kind of task manager for JavaScript in Firefox 3?,"It's probably the awesome firefox3 fsync ""bug"", which is a giant pile of fail. In summary Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database Every time you load a page it writes to this database several times SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff. The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI. ",javascript
How do you open a file in C++?,"There are three ways to do this, depending on your needs. You could use the old-school C way and call fopen/fread/fclose, or you could use the C++ fstream facilities (ifstream/ofstream), or if you're using MFC, use the CFile class, which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations. All of these are suitable for both text and binary, though none have a specific readline functionality. What you'd most likely do instead in that case is use the fstream classes (fstream.h) and use the stream operators (&lt;&lt; and >>) or the read function to read/write blocks of text: int nsize = 10; char *somedata; ifstream myfile; myfile.open(""&lt;path to file&gt;""); myfile.read(somedata,nsize); myfile.close(); Note that, if you're using Visual Studio 2005 or higher, traditional fstream may not be available (there's a new Microsoft implementation, which is slightly different, but accomplishes the same thing).

How should I unit test a code-generator?,"I started writing up a summary of my experience with my own code generator, then went back and re-read your question and found you had already touched upon the same issues yourself, focus on the execution results instead of the code layout/look. Problem is, this is hard to test, the generated code might not be suited to actually run in the environment of the unit test system, and how do you encode the expected results? I've found that you need to break down the code generator into smaller pieces and unit test those. Unit testing a full code generator is more like integration testing than unit testing if you ask me.

How can I determine the IP of my router/gateway in Java?,"That is not as easy as it sounds.  Java is platform independent, so I am not sure how to do it in Java.  I am guessing that .NET contacts some web site which reports it back.  There are a couple ways to go.  First, a deeper look into the ICMP protocol may give you the information you need.  You can also trace the IP you go through (your route).  When you encounter an IP that is not in the following ranges: 10.0.0.0 â 10.255.255.255 172.16.0.0 â 172.31.255.255 192.168.0.0 â 192.168.255.255 it is the IP one hop away from yours, and probably shares a few octets of information with your IP.

How to setup site-wide variables in php?,"Most PHP sites should have a file (I call it a header) that you include on every single page of the site.

Speed difference in using inline strings vs concatenation in php5?,"Well, as with all ""What might be faster in real life"" questions, you can't beat a real life test. function timeFunc($function, $runs) {   $times = array();   for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $runs; $i++)   {     $time = microtime();     call_user_func($function);     $times[$i] = microtime() - $time;   }   return array_sum($times) / $runs; } function Method1() {    $foo = 'some words';   for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++)     $t = ""these are $foo""; } function Method2() {   $foo = 'some words';   for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++)     $t = ""these are {$foo}""; } function Method3()  {   $foo = 'some words';   for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++)     $t = ""these are "" . $foo; } print timeFunc('Method1', 10) .

""\n""; Give it a few runs to page everything in, then... 0.0035568 0.0035388 0.0025394 So, as expected, the interpolation are virtually identical (noise level differences, probably due to the extra characters the interpolation engine needs to handle). Straight up concatenation is about 66% of the speed, which is no great shock. The interpolation parser will look, find nothing to do, then finish with a simple internal string concat. Even if the concat were expensive, the interpolator will still have to do it, after all the work to parse out the variable and trim/copy up the original string. Updates By Somnath: I added Method4() to above real time logic. function Method4()  {   $foo = 'some words';   for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++)     $t = 'these are ' . $foo; } print timeFunc('Method4', 10) .

"How do threads work in Python, and what are common Python-threading specific pitfalls?","Below is a basic threading sample. It will spawn 20 threads; each thread will output its thread number.

This is how they get the ""parallel"" effect.  In my example my Foo class extends thread, I then implement the run method, which is where the code that you would like to run in a thread goes.

"Is Java ""pass-by-reference"" or ""pass-by-value""?","Java is always pass by value, with no exceptions, ever. So how is it that anyone can be at all confused by this, and believe that Java is pass by reference, or think they have an example of Java acting as pass by reference? The key point is that Java never provides direct access to the values of objects themselves, in any circumstances. The only access to objects is through a reference to that object. Because Java objects are always accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables and method arguments as being objects, when pedantically they are only references to objects. The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature. So, when calling a method For primitive arguments (int, long, etc.), the pass by value is the actual value of the primitive (for example, 3). For objects, the pass by value is the value of the reference to the object. So if you have doSomething(foo) and public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. } the two Foos have copied references that point to the same objects. Naturally, passing by value a reference to an object looks very much like (and is indistinguishable in practice from) passing an object by reference. ",java

When can DataInputStream.skipBytes(n) not skip n bytes?,"1) There might not be that much data available to read (the other end of the pipe might not have sent that much data yet), and the implementing class might be non-blocking (i.e. it will just return what it can, rather than waiting for enough data to fulfil the request). I don't know if any implementations actually behave in this way, however, but the interface is designed to permit it. Another option is simply that the file gets closed part-way through the read. 2) Either readFully() (which will always wait for enough input or else fail) or call skipBytes() in a loop.  I think the former is probably better, unless the array is truly vast. ",java

This sounds like it may be a bug (undocumented feature...) in windows.  It should probably not be doing this for a dual screen setup.   One option to fix this is rather than setting it to be ""full screen"" just make the window the same size as the screen with location (0,0).

CakePHP ACL Database Setup: ARO / ACO structure?,"CakePHP's built-in ACL system is really powerful, but poorly documented in terms of actual implementation details. A system that we've used with some success in a number of CakePHP-based projects is as follows. It's a modification of some group-level access systems that have been documented elsewhere. Our system's aims are to have a simple system where users are authorised on a group-level, but they can have specific additional rights on items that were created by them, or on a per-user basis. We wanted to avoid having to create a specific entry for each user (or, more specifically for each ARO) in the aros_acos table. We have a Users table, and a Roles table. Users user_id, user_name, role_id Roles id, role_name Create the ARO tree for each role (we usually have 4 roles - Unauthorised Guest (id 1), Authorised User (id 2), Site Moderator (id 3) and Administrator (id 4)) : cake acl create aro / Role.1 cake acl create aro 1 Role.2  ... etc ... After this, you have to use SQL or phpMyAdmin or similar to add aliases for all of these, as the cake command line tool doesn't do it. We use 'Role-{id}' and 'User-{id}' for all of ours. We then create a ROOT ACO -  cake acl create aco / 'ROOT' and then create ACOs for all the controllers under this ROOT one: cake acl create aco 'ROOT' 'MyController' ... etc ... So far so normal. We add an additional field in the aros_acos table called _editown  which we can use as an additional action in the ACL component's actionMap. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `aros_acos` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, `aro_id` int(11) default NULL, `aco_id` int(11) default NULL, `_create` int(11) NOT NULL default '0', `_read` int(11) NOT NULL default '0', `_update` int(11) NOT NULL default '0', `_delete` int(11) NOT NULL default '0', `_editown` int(11) NOT NULL default '0', PRIMARY KEY  (`id`), KEY `acl` (`aro_id`,`aco_id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8; We can then setup the Auth component to use the 'crud' method, which validates the requested controller/action against an AclComponent::check(). In the app_controller we have something along the lines of: private function setupAuth() {     if(isset($this-&gt;Auth)) {         ....         $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = 'crud';         $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;actionMap = array( 'index'     =&gt; 'read',                         'add'       =&gt; 'create',                         'edit'      =&gt; 'update'                         'editMine'  =&gt; 'editown',                         'view'      =&gt; 'read'                         ... etc ...                         );         ... etc ...     } } Again, this is fairly standard CakePHP stuff. We then have a checkAccess method in the AppController that adds in the group-level stuff to check whether to check a group ARO or a user ARO for access: private function checkAccess() {     if(!$user = $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;user()) {         $role_alias = 'Role-1';         $user_alias = null;     } else {         $role_alias = 'Role-' . $user['User']['role_id'];         $user_alias = 'User-' . $user['User']['id'];     }     // do we have an aro for this user?     if($user_alias &amp;&amp; ($user_aro = $this-&gt;User-&gt;Aro-&gt;findByAlias($user_alias))) {         $aro_alias = $user_alias;     } else {         $aro_alias = $role_alias;     }     if ('editown' == $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;actionMap[$this-&gt;action]) {         if($this-&gt;Acl-&gt;check($aro_alias, $this-&gt;name, 'editown') and $this-&gt;isMine()) {             $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow();         } else {             $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = 'controller';             $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('*');         }     } else {         // check this user-level aro for access         if($this-&gt;Acl-&gt;check($aro_alias, $this-&gt;name, $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;actionMap[$this-&gt;action])) {             $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow();         } else {             $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = 'controller';             $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('*');         }     } } The setupAuth() and checkAccess() methods are called in the AppController's beforeFilter() callback. There's an isMine method in the AppControler too (see below) that just checks that the user_id of the requested item is the same as the currently authenticated user. I've left this out for clarity. That's really all there is to it. You can then allow / deny particular groups access to specific acos -  cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'read' cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'editown' cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'update' cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'delete' I'm sure you get the picture. Anyway, this answer's way longer than I intended it to be, and it probably makes next to no sense, but I hope it's some help to you ... -- edit -- As requested, here's an edited (purely for clarity - there's a lot of stuff in our boilerplate code that's meaningless here) isMine() method that we have in our AppController. I've removed a lot of error checking stuff too, but this is the essence of it: function isMine($model=null, $id=null, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {     if(empty($model)) {         // default model is first item in $this-&gt;uses array         $model = $this-&gt;uses[0];     }     if(empty($id)) {         if(!empty($this-&gt;passedArgs['id'])) {         $id = $this-&gt;passedArgs['id'];         } elseif(!empty($this-&gt;passedArgs[0])) {             $id = $this-&gt;passedArgs[0];         }     }     if(is_array($id)) {         foreach($id as $i) {             if(!$this-&gt;_isMine($model, $i, $usermodel, $foreignkey)) {                 return false;             }         }         return true;     }     return $this-&gt;_isMine($model, $id, $usermodel, $foreignkey); } function _isMine($model, $id, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {     $user = Configure::read('curr.loggedinuser'); // this is set in the UsersController on successful login     if(isset($this-&gt;$model)) {         $model = $this-&gt;$model;     } else {         $model = ClassRegistry::init($model);     }     //read model     if(!($record = $model-&gt;read(null, $id))) {         return false;     }     //get foreign key     if($usermodel == $model-&gt;alias) {         if($record[$model-&gt;alias][$model-&gt;primaryKey] == $user['User']['id']) {             return true;         }     } elseif($record[$model-&gt;alias][$foreignkey] == $user['User']['id']) {         return true;     }     return false; } ",php
How do prepared statements work?,"From what I understand, prepared statements will reuse the generated SQL plan if it is the same statement, so the database will see the same prepared statement and not have to do the work to figure out how to query the database. I would say the extra work of saving the prepared statement in Product::getPrice_A is not typically very helpful, more because it can obscure the code rather than an issue of performance.  When dealing with performance, I feel it's always best to focus on code clarity and then performance when you have real statistics that indicate a problem. I would say ""yes, the extra work is unnecessary"" (regardless of if it really boosts performance).  Also, I am not a very big DB expert, but the performance gain of prepared statements is something I heard from others, and it is at the database level, not the code level (so if the code is actually invoking a parameterized statement on the actual DB, then the DB can do these execution plan caching... though depending on the database, you may get the benefit even without the parameterized statement). Anyways, if you are really worried about (and seeing) database performance issues, you should look into a caching solution... of which I would highly recommend memcached.  With such a solution, you can cache your query results and not even hit the database for things you access frequently. ",php

When do function-level static variables get allocated/initialized?,"Static variables are allocated inside a code segment -- they are part of the executable image, and so are mapped in already initialized. Static variables within function scope are treated the same, the scoping is purely a language level construct.

There are some other facets to initialization you can take advantage off -- for example shared segments allow different instances of your executable running at once to access the same static variables. In C++ (globally scoped) static objects have their constructors called as part of the program start up, under the control of the C runtime library.  Under Visual C++ at least the order that objects are initialized in can be controlled by the init_seg pragma. ",c++

How can I get Axis 1.4 to not generate several prefixes for the same XML namespace?,"I have the same issue.  For the moment, I've worked around it by writing a BasicHandler extension, and then walking the SOAPPart myself and moving the namespace reference up to a parent node.

A snippet to monitor the last INSERT/UPDATE in an Oracle DB from C#?,"One possible solution is: Add a DATE field that represents the last update time to MY_TABLE table.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER my_table_insert_trg   BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE   ON my_table   FOR EACH ROW   BEGIN      :new.last_update_time := SYSDATE;   END; Now you can issue the following query every 5 minutes SELECT max(last_update_time) FROM my_table; and it will give you the time when your table was last updated. There is no easy way to get a notification from Oracle, sorry. ",c#
Why does a C/C++ program often have optimization turned off in debug mode?,"Without any optimization on, the flow through your code is linear.  If you are on line 5 and single step, you step to line 6.  With optimization on, you can get instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and all sorts of optimizations. For example: void foo() { 1:  int i; 2:  for(i = 0; i &lt 2; ) 3:    i++; 4:  return; In this example, without optimization, you could single step through the code and hit lines 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4 With optimization on, you might get an execution path that looks like: 2, 3, 3, 4 or even just 4! (The function does nothing after all...) Bottom line, debugging code with optimization enabled can be a royal pain! Especially if you have large functions. Note that turning on optimization changes the code! In certain environment (safety critical systems), this is unacceptable and the code being debugged has to be the code shipped. Gotta debug with optimization on in that case. While the optimized and non-optimized code should be ""functionally"" equivalent, under certain circumstances, the behavior will change. Here is a simplistic example:     int* ptr = 0xdeadbeef;  // some address to memory-mapped I/O device     *ptr = 0;   // setup hardware device     while(*ptr == 1) {    // loop until hardware device is done        // do something     } With optimization off, this is straightforward, and you kinda know what to expect. However, if you turn optimization on, a couple of things might happen: The compiler might optimize the while block away (we init to 0, it'll never be 1) Instead of accessing memory, pointer access might be moved to a register->No I/O Update memory access might be cached (not necessarily compiler optimization related) In all these cases, the behavior would be drastically different and most likely wrong.

Use some encryption algorithm such as AES, Twofish etc. You must also take into consideration where your client and server are. If they both are in the same machine, there is no use of using an encryption. If they are in different machines, use some encryption algorithm to send sensitive data.

How to Truncate a string in PHP to the word closest to a certain number of characters?,"By using the wordwrap function. It splits the texts in multiple lines such that the maximum width is the one you specified, breaking at word boundaries. After splitting, you simply take the first line: substr($string, 0, strpos(wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width), ""\n"")); One thing this oneliner doesn't handle is the case when the text itself is shorter than the desired width. To handle this edge-case, one should do something like: if (strlen($string) &gt; $your_desired_width)  {     $string = wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width);     $string = substr($string, 0, strpos($string, ""\n"")); } The above solution has the problem of prematurely cutting the text if it contains a newline before the actual cutpoint. Here a version which solves this problem: function tokenTruncate($string, $your_desired_width) {   $parts = preg_split('/([\s\n\r]+)/', $string, null, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE);   $parts_count = count($parts);   $length = 0;   $last_part = 0;   for (; $last_part &lt; $parts_count; ++$last_part) {     $length += strlen($parts[$last_part]);     if ($length &gt; $your_desired_width) { break; }   }   return implode(array_slice($parts, 0, $last_part)); } Also, here is the PHPUnit testclass used to test the implementation: class TokenTruncateTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {   public function testBasic() {     $this-&gt;assertEquals(""1 3 5 7 9 "",       tokenTruncate(""1 3 5 7 9 11 14"", 10));   }   public function testEmptyString() {     $this-&gt;assertEquals("""",       tokenTruncate("""", 10));   }   public function testShortString() {     $this-&gt;assertEquals(""1 3"",       tokenTruncate(""1 3"", 10));   }   public function testStringTooLong() {     $this-&gt;assertEquals("""",       tokenTruncate(""toooooooooooolooooong"", 10));   }   public function testContainingNewline() {     $this-&gt;assertEquals(""1 3\n5 7 9 "",       tokenTruncate(""1 3\n5 7 9 11 14"", 10));   } } EDIT : Special UTF8 characters like 'Ã ' are not handled. Add 'u' at the end of the REGEX to handle it: $parts = preg_split('/([\s\n\r]+)/u', $string, null, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE); ",php

For example, my app needed to retain the successfully-logged-in LDAP context for further use by the user once logged in -- the app's purpose is to let users log in via their AD credentials and then perform further AD-related functions.  So because of that, I have a custom authentication token, LdapAuthenticationToken, that I pass around (rather than Spring's default Authentication token) which allows me to attach the LDAP context.  In LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I create that token and pass it back out; in LdapAuthenticatorImpl.authenticate(), I attach the logged-in context to the return object so that it can be added to the user's Spring authentication object. Also, in LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I assign all logged-in users the ROLE_USER role -- that's what lets me then test for that role in my intercept-url elements.  You'll want to make this match whatever role you want to test for, or even assign roles based on Active Directory groups or whatever. Finally, and a corollary to that, the way I implemented LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate() gives all users with valid AD accounts the same ROLE_USER role.  Obviously, in that method, you can perform further tests on the user (i.e., is the user in a specific AD group?) and assign roles that way, or even test for some condition before even granting the user access at all.

How do I efficiently search an array to fill in form fields?,I'm assuming that php has an associative array (commonly called dictionary or hashtable). The most efficient routine would be to run over the array once and put the fields into a dictionary keyed on the field name. Then instead of having to search through the original array when you want to find a specific field (an O(n)) operation. You just used the dictionary to retrieve it by the name of the field in an O(1) (or constant) operation. Of course the first pass over the array to populate the dictionary would be O(n) but that's a one time cost rather than paying that same penalty for every lookup.  ,php

What is a variable's linkage and storage specifier?,"The storage class specifier controls the storage and the linkage of your variables. These are two concepts that are different. C specifies the following specifiers for variables: auto, extern, register, static. Storage The storage duration determines how long your variable will live in ram. There are three types of storage duration: static, automatic and dynamic. static If your variable is declared at file scope, or with an extern or static specifier, it will have static storage. The variable will exist for as long as the program is executing. No execution time is spent to create these variables. automatic If the variable is declared in a function, but without the extern or static specifier, it has automatic storage. The variable will exist only while you are executing the function.  Once you return, the variable no longer exist.  Automatic storage is typically done on the stack.  It is a very fast operation to create these variables (simply increment the stack pointer by the size). dynamic If you use malloc (or new in C++) you are using dynamic storage.  This storage will exist until you call free (or delete). This is the most expensive way to create storage, as the system must manage allocation and deallocation dynamically. Linkage Linkage specifies who can see and reference the variable. There are three types of linkage: internal linkage, external linkage and no linkage. no linkage This variable is only visible where it was declared. Typically applies to variables declared in a function. internal linkage This variable will be visible to all the functions within the file (called a translation unit), but other files will not know it exists. external linkage The variable will be visible to other translation units.  These are often thought of as ""global variables"". Here is a table describing the storage and linkage characteristics based on the specifiers   Storage Class   Function            File    Specifier        Scope              Scope   -----------------------------------------------------   none           automatic         static                        no linkage        external linkage  extern          static            static                  external linkage  external linkage  static          static            static                  no linkage        internal linkage   auto           automatic         invalid                  no linkage register         automatic         invalid                  no linkage ",c++

For example. session_start(); $old_sessionid = session_id(); session_regenerate_id(); $new_sessionid = session_id(); Another thing that is good practice is if you are doing some kind of user login as part of the system, completely invalidate and empty the session data on a logout to insure that the user is truly logged out of the system.

How does c# figure out the hash code for an object?,"I don't have the book reference anymore, and I'll have to find it just to confirm, but I thought the default base hash just hashed together all of the members of your object.  It got access to them because of the way the CLR worked, so it wasn't something that you could write as well as they had. That is completely from memory of something I briefly read so take it for what you will. Edit: The book was Inside C# from MS Press. The one with the Saw blade on the cover.  The author spent a good deal of time explaining how things were implemented in the CLR, how the language translated down to MSIL, ect. ect.  If you can find the book it's not a bad read. Edit: Form the link provided it looks like   Object.GetHashCode() uses an   internal field in the System.Object class to generate the hash value. Each   object created is assigned a unique object key, stored as an integer,when it   is created. These keys start at 1 and increment every time a new object of   any type gets created. Hmm I guess I need to write a few of my own hash codes, if I expect to use objects as hash keys. ",c#
"iPhone programming - impressions, opinions?","I agree with your sentiments.  Coming from Microsoft development tools (and eclipse) to XCode is kind of harsh.

Trying to carefully control audio/video file playback is one example. Objective-C, however, is great.  I really like the language, despite its quirks and idiosyncrasies (messages to null isn't a run-time exception?  really?)  Once your C++ eyes get used to the syntax, loosely-typed anonymous messaging actually ends up being really cool to play with (if somewhat dangerous and prone to RTEs.) ",c#

Then convert the string as you have above, still catching the exception for the few invalid strings that get through the sanity check.

Why unicode() uses str() on my object only with no encoding given?,"unicode does not guess the encoding of your text. If your object can print itself as unicode, define the __unicode__() method that returns a Unicode string. The secret is that unicode(r) is not actually calling __str__() itself. Instead, it's looking for a __unicode__() method. The default implementation of __unicode__() will call __str__() and then attempt to decode it using the ascii charset. When you pass the encoding, unicode() expects the first object to be something that can be decoded -- that is, an instance of basestring.   Behavior is weird because it tries to decode as ascii if I don't pass 'utf-8'. But if I pass 'utf-8' it gives a different error... That's because when you specify ""utf-8"", it treats the first parameter as a string-like object to be decoded. Without it, it treats the parameter as an object to be coerced to unicode. I do not understand the confusion. If you know that the object's text attribute will always be UTF-8 encoded, just define __unicode__() and then everything will work fine. ",python
Standard concise way to copy a file in Java?,"As toolkit mentions above, Apache Commons IO is the way to go, specifically FileUtils.copyFile(); it handles all the heavy lifting for you. And as a postscript, note that recent versions of FileUtils (such as the 2.0.1 release) have added the use of NIO for copying files; NIO can significantly increase file-copying performance, in a large part because the NIO routines defer copying directly to the OS/filesystem rather than handle it by reading and writing bytes through the Java layer.  So if you're looking for performance, it might be worth checking that you are using a recent version of FileUtils. ",java

Any quirks I should be aware of in Drupal's XML-RPC and BlogAPI implementations?,"While the XML-RPC facility is pretty stable and works well, the BlogAPI module has various issues, especially with discovery, that make using it for anything but regular blogs painful. Currently, there is no use of blogIds in the generated Really Simple Discovery document (of which only one exists for a site) or for the blogging APIs implemented in BlogAPI. Which blog receives a post is determined by user credentials, which works fine as long as only one node type is available for access through BlogAPI, but when you try and have two or more node types available through the module, things tend to fall apart. Looking at the state of BlogAPI in Drupal's HEAD on CVS, we might not see a solution to this until 8.x at the earliest. However, there are several people working on redeveloping BlogAPI as a third party module, perhaps to merge back in to Drupal core at some later date. If you want to use a well-known blogging API, it might be best to get involved with their effort.

Objections against Java Webstart?,"In my company we used Java Web Start to deploy Eclipse RCP applications.  It was a pain to setup, but it works very well once in place.

When you have a web application, people expects they can use it right from the browser.  Java Web Start is neither here not there... It is widely used in intranets, though. ",java

Can a web service return a stream?,"Stephen Denne has a Metro implementation that satisfies your requirement. My answer is provided below after a short explination as to why that is the case. Most Web Service implementations that are built using HTTP as the message protocol are REST compliant, in that they only allow simple send-receive patterns and nothing more. This greatly improves interoperability, as all the various platforms can understand this simple architecture (for instance a Java web service talking to a .NET web service). If you want to maintain this you could provide chunking. boolean uploadFile(String username, String password, String fileName, int currentChunk, int totalChunks, byte[] chunk); This would require some footwork in cases where you don't get the chunks in the right order (Or you can just require the chunks come in the right order), but it would probably be pretty easy to implement.

What are the best/most popular ways to do aspect-oriented programming (AOP) in C#/.Net?,"I've played around with rolling my own, for several different types of things.  I've had some luck.  In general, I make an interface, implement it with a class, and then make a proxy which implements the interface, does whatever precondition steps I want, calls the real object's method, and then does whatever postcondition steps I want.  One of the main annoyances of mine with this approach is that you can't have constructors in an interface, and you also can't have static methods in an interface, so there's no real obvious place to put that type of code.  The hard part is the code generation - because you're either going to emit IL, or you're going to emit C# that you have to compile.  But that's just been my approach.  And it forced me to think about one aspect at a time, really - I hadn't gotten to the point where I could abstract out the ""Aspect"" and think in those terms.  In short: roll your own or find a toolset you like, probably from Eric Bodden's list. ",c#

How to configure Tomcat JULI logging to roll log files?,"Update: I see your point now after reading more. ""Tomcat's JULI implementation is not intended to be a fully-featured logging libary, only a simple bridge to those libraries. However, JULI does provide several properties for configuring the its handlers. These are listed below.""  Funny that they say that the default java.util.Logging implementation is too limited then they work around it by providing an even more limiting implementation. FileHandler javadocs java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit specifies an approximate maximum amount to write (in bytes) to any one file. If this is zero, then there is no limit. (Defaults to no limit). java.util.logging.FileHandler.count specifies how many output files to cycle through (defaults to 1).  for the one file per web app, you probably want to separate it by the name of the logger and it depends on how the loggers are created for each app. If they're based off the package or class name then you can filter the logs based on that.  It looks like the sample on the link you provided tells how to do this org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].level = INFO org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].handlers = \    2localhost.org.apache.juli.FileHandler ",java
What's the best way to read and parse a large text file over the network?,"If you are reading a sequential file you want to read it in line by line over the network.  You need a transfer method capable of streaming.  You'll need to review your IO streaming technology to figure this out. Large IO operations like this won't benefit much by multithreading since you can probably process the items as fast as you can read them over the network. Your other great option is to put the log parser on the server, and download the results. ",c#

"Are ""dirty reads"" safe to use in Terracotta?","A dirty read is a dirty read. Terracotta, being distributed/clustered, only adds the possibility to read even older values of the shared mutable state that you are accessing without proper synchronization. You should note that, under the memory model in Java 5, you are not guaranteed to ever read an updated value if you don't use proper synchronization. Terracotta may decide to take advantage of this possibility. In fact, any JVM may, at their leisure, take advantage of it. Even if it might work on your machine, it may break on other machines. It may break on minor updates of the JVM, and it may break for the same version of the same JVM on a different CPU. With that in mind, you can say that dirty reads isn't safe in any JVM... Unless you don't mind the possibility that you won't ever be able to read the updates that other threads make - an unlikely situation but it could happen. Also, when you actually follow your link to Terracottas wiki, it says that the article has been removed and that the pattern is discouraged. ",java

Try this:  public class MyServer {     public static final int PORT = 12345;     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {         ServerSocket ss = ServerSocketFactory.getDefault().createServerSocket(PORT);         Socket s = ss.accept();         Thread.sleep(5000);         ss.close();         s.close();     } } public class MyClient {     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {         Socket s = SocketFactory.getDefault().createSocket(""localhost"", MyServer.PORT);         System.out.println("" connected: "" + s.isConnected());         Thread.sleep(10000);         System.out.println("" connected: "" + s.isConnected());     } } Start the server, start the client. You'll see that it prints ""connected: true"" twice, even though the socket is closed the second time. The only way to really find out is by reading (you'll get -1 as return value) or writing (an IOException (broken pipe) will be thrown) on the associated Input/OutputStreams. ",java

Is it feasible to create a REST client with Flex?,"There are definite shortcomings of Flex's ability to act as a pure RESTful client. The comments below are from this blog:   The problem is HTTPService class has   several major limitations:         Only GET and POST methods are supported out of the box (unless you   use FDS and set useProxy attribute to   true)   Not able to set request headers and there is no access to response   headers. Therefore I am not able to   access the response body in the case   of an error.   It HTTPService gets a status code anything other 200, it consider   an error. (event 201, ouch!!). The   FaultEvent doesnât provide information   about the status code any response   body. The Flex client will have no   idea what went wrong.

How to position one element relative to another with jQuery?,"tl;dr: (try it here) If you have the following HTML: &lt;div id=""menu"" style=""display: none;""&gt;    &lt;!-- menu stuff in here --&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menu item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=""parent""&gt;Hover over me to show the menu here&lt;/div&gt; then you can use the following JavaScript code: $("".parent"").mouseover(function() {     // .position() uses position relative to the offset parent,      var pos = $(this).position();     // .outerWidth() takes into account border and padding.     var width = $(this).outerWidth();     //show the menu directly over the placeholder     $(""#menu"").css({         position: ""absolute"",         top: pos.top + ""px"",         left: (pos.left + width) + ""px""     }).show(); }); But it doesn't work! This will work as long as the menu and the placeholder have the same offset parent. If they don't, and you don't have nested CSS rules that care where in the DOM the #menu element is, use: $(this).append($(""#menu"")); just before the line that positions the #menu element. But it still doesn't work! You might have some weird layout that doesn't work with this approach. In that case, just use jQuery.ui's position plugin (as mentioned in an answer below), which handles every conceivable eventuality. Note that you'll have to show() the menu element before calling position({...}); the plugin can't position hidden elements. Update notes 3 years later in 2012: (The original solution is archived here for posterity) So, it turns out that the original method I had here was far from ideal. In particular, it would fail if: the menu's offset parent is not the placeholder's offset parent the placeholder has a border/padding Luckily, jQuery introduced methods (position() and outerWidth()) way back in 1.2.6 that make finding the right values in the latter case here a lot easier. For the former case, appending the menu element to the placeholder works (but will break CSS rules based on nesting). ",jquery

"What is the difference between Ruby and Python versions of""self""?","Well, I don't know much about Ruby. But the obvious point about Python's ""self"" is that it's not a ""keyword"" ...it's just the name of an argument that's sent to your method. You can use any name you like for this argument. ""Self"" is just a convention. For example : class X :     def __init__(a,val) :         a.x = val     def p(b) :         print b.x x = X(6) x.p() Prints the number 6 on the terminal. In the constructor the self object is actually called a. But in the p() method, it's called b. Update : In October 2008, Guido pointed out that having an explicit self was also necessary to allow Python decorators to be general enough to work on pure functions, methods or classmethods : http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html ",python
Run custom Javascript whenever a client-side ASP.NET validator is triggered?,"The best solution I've identified for my specific situation is this: Create a global JS data structure mapping control IDs to a visibility state. Register the client IDs of the validators (or anything else, for that matter) in this data structure. Every 250 milliseconds, loop through the global data structure and compare the cached visiblity state with the element's current state. If the states are different, update the cache and run the custom resize script. This is ugly in lots of ways, and it's only a solution for my specific scenario, not the abstract case where we want to piggyback arbitrary code onto the showing/hiding of a validator.

Simply changing the file from Unicode into ASCII is easy, however, getting all of the Unicode characters to translate into reasonable ASCII counterparts (many letters are not available in both encodings) is another. This Python Unicode tutorial may give you a better idea of what happens to Unicode strings that are translated to ASCII: http://www.reportlab.com/i18n/python_unicode_tutorial.html Here's a useful quote from the site:   Python 1.6 also gets a ""unicode""   built-in function, to which you can   specify the encoding: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('hello') u'hello' &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('hello', 'ascii') u'hello' &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('hello', 'iso-8859-1') u'hello' &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   All three of these return the same   thing, since the characters in 'Hello'   are common to all three encodings.      Now let's encode something with a   European accent, which is outside of   ASCII. What you see at a console may   depend on your operating system   locale; Windows lets me type in   ISO-Latin-1. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a = unicode('AndrÃ©','latin-1') &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a u'Andr\202'   If you can't type an acute letter e,   you can enter the string 'Andr\202',   which is unambiguous.

It's something that wasn't really wrong at first, but is getting more-so all the time. The basic structure is similar enough that most simple questions do still work between the two, though. There is an entire Wikipedia article on this topic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B The biggest fallacy that comes from this is that because someone is well-versed in C, they will be equally good at C++.

Are C++ Templates just Macros in disguise?,"They are parsed by the compiler and not by a preprocessor that runs before the compiler. Here's what MSDN says about it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa903548(VS.71).aspx   Here are some problems with the macro:         There is no way for the compiler to verify that the macro parameters are of compatible types.    The macro is expanded without any special type checking.   The i and j parameters are evaluated twice. For example, if either parameter has a postincremented variable, the increment is performed two times.   Because macros are expanded by the preprocessor, compiler error messages will refer to the expanded macro, rather than the macro definition itself. Also, the macro will show up in expanded form during debugging.    If that's not enough for you, I don't know what is. ",c++

What's a good and stable C++ tree implementation?,I am going to suggest using std::map instead of a tree.

How do I Update a GridView from a Page Method from code behind?,"You can dynamically/programmatically build the GridView control.  Then in your WebMethod, you can call RenderControl() method to retrieve the HTML content of the rendered GridView control.  Return that content from the WebMethod and have the callback JavaScript function inject the HTML content into your placeholder element's innerHTML property. Another option is to do your data binding on the client-side.  So all the WebMethod has to do is pass back the data (excluding presentational markup), for example in a JSON-type format.  Then you can use something like javascript templates to render the grid with data.  This approach takes GridView control completely out of the picture, but depending on your needs, it may be a viable option. ",jquery

Detect that the Internet connection is offline?,"You can determine that the connection is lost by making failed XHR requests. The standard approach is to retry the request a few times.  If it doesn't go through, alert the user to check the connection, and fail gracefully. Sidenote: To put the entire application in an ""offline"" state may lead to a lot of error-prone work of handling state.. wireless connections may come and go, etc.  So your best bet may be to just fail gracefully, preserve the data, and alert the user.. allowing them to eventually fix the connection problem if there is one, and to continue using your app with a fair amount of forgiveness. Sidenote: You could check a reliable site like google for connectivity, but this may not be entirely useful as just trying to make your own request, because while google may be available, your own application may not be, and you're still going to have to handle your own connection problem.  Trying to send a ping to google would be a good way to confirm that the internet connection itself is down, so if that information is useful to you, then it might be worth the trouble. Sidenote: Sending a Ping could be achieved in the same way that you would make any kind of two-way ajax request, but sending a ping to google in this case would pose some challenges.  First, we'd have the same cross-domain issues that are typically encountered in making ajax communications.  One option is to set up a server-side proxy, wherein we actually ping google (or whatever site), and return the results of the ping to the app.. This is a catch-22, because if the internet connection is actually the problem, we won't be able to get to the server, and if the connection problem is only on our own domain, we won't be able to tell the difference. Other cross-domain techniques could be tried, for example, embedding an iframe in your page which points to google.com, and then polling the iframe for success/failure (examine the contents, etc).  Embedding an image may not really tell us anything, because we need a useful response from the communication mechanism in order to draw a good conclusion about what's going on.  So again, determining the state of the internet connection as a whole may be more trouble than it's worth.  You'll have to weight these options out for your specific app. ",javascript

How to get a complete list of object's methods and attributes?,"For the complete list of attributes, the short answer is: no. The problem is that the attributes are actually defined as the arguments accepted by the getattr built-in function.

The dir function returns the keys in the __dict__ attribute, i.e. all the attributes accessible if the __getattr__ method is not reimplemented. For the second question, it does not really make sense. Actually, methods are callable attributes, nothing more. You could though filter callable attributes, and, using the inspect module determine the class methods, methods or functions. ",python

How does one weed out dependencies in a large project?,"Personally, I think you have to start by assessing the scale of the problem.  It's going to be fairly painful, but I'd make a list of the dependencies and work out exactly which parts of the project use which ones. Then I'd work out exactly what features of each you're actually making use of (in many cases, you'll end up having a massive third party library which you're using a tiny part of). Once you have this information, you'll at least know what you're dealing with. My next step would be to look at all of the dependencies that you only use to a small extent.  Checking around might uncover things that you could use from other libraries that would eliminate the lesser used libraries. I'd also have a look around to see if there's anything small that you could just re-write and include in your own code-base. Finally, I'd have a look around at the vendors of your dependencies and their competitors to see if the latest versions contain more functionality that will allow you to eliminate a few others. Then you're just left wondering whether it's better to be highly dependent on a few vendors, or less dependent on a lot of vendors!!  ;o) ",java

Are there caveats to dynamicly creating a form with javascript?,"I do this all the time.  Works really well.

Ant also has a native2ascii task that runs native2ascii on a set of input files and sends output files wherever you want, so I was able to add a builder that does that in Eclipse so that my source folder has the strings in their original encoding for easy editing and building automatically puts converted files of the same name in the output folder.

Their listeners get JTextPane's current selection start and end index positions like this : jpane.getSelectionStart()  or  jpane.getSelectionEnd() and then insert opening and closing html/rtf tags at those locations.  Undo is easy too - maintain a simple stack of the string contents of the Jpanel, every time the user does an edit action, a simple history.push(jpane.getText()) would store the state, and the undo button would be as simple as jpane.setText(history.pop()).

How do I prevent and/or handle a StackOverflowException?,"From Microsoft:   Starting with the .NET Framework   version 2.0, a StackOverflowException   object cannot be caught by a try-catch   block and the corresponding process is   terminated by default. Consequently,   users are advised to write their code   to detect and prevent a stack   overflow. For example, if your   application depends on recursion, use   a counter or a state condition to   terminate the recursive loop. I'm assuming the exception is happening within an internal .NET method, and not in your code. You can do a couple things. Write code that checks the xsl for infinite recursion and notifies the user prior to applying a transform (Ugh). Load the XslTransform code into a separate process (Hacky, but less work). You can use the Process class to load the assembly that will apply the transform into a separate process, and alert the user of the failure if it dies, without killing your main app. EDIT: I just tested, here is how to do it: MainProcess: // This is just an example, obviously you'll want to pass args to this.

What is the easiest way to encrypt a password when I save it to the registry?,"One option would be to store the hash (SHA1, MD5) of the password instead of the clear-text password, and whenever you want to see if the password is good, just compare it to that hash. If you need secure storage (for example for a password that you will use to connect to a service), then the problem is more complicated. If it is just for authentication, then it would be enough to use the hash. ",c#

How would you improve this algorithm? (c string reversal),"I had this question once. That's the first answer that comes to mind, but the follow-up is, ""now do it without allocating any memory."" int length = strlen(string); for(int i = 0; i &lt; length/2; i++) {   char c = string[i];   string[i] = string[length - i];   string[length - i] = c; } EDIT: Some folks have expressed disdain for not using pointers. This is a tiny bit more readable, though not completely optimal. Others have entered the pointer solution, so I won't repeat it here. One commenter challenged that it should be doable without a (stack based) holding cell for the swap. The mechanism for doing that is bitwise XOR. Replace the inside of the loop with string[i] = string[i] ^ string[length - i]; string[length - i] = string[i] ^ string[length - i]; string[i] = string[i] ^ string[length - i]; But in general, modern compilers can optimize out the local variable of a naive swap.

How to detect the current sharepoint pages from the client machine?,WatiN will allow you to attach to IE instances and get the current url from them.

Also, with inline-heavy use of C++ (including the STL), your program can become much slower without optimization. ",c++
"How does ""Edit and continue"" work in Visual Studio?","My guess is that it recompiles the app (and for small changes this wouldn't mean very much would have to be recompiled). Then since Microsoft makes both the compiler and debugger they can make guarantees about how memory and the like are laid out. So, they can use the debugging API to re-write the code segments with the new ones as long as the changes are small enough. If the changes redirect to entirely new code, this can obviously be loaded into memory in a similar style as DLLs. Microsoft also has a mechanism for ""hot-patching"". Functions have a 2 byte no-op instruction usually something like ""mov edx, edx"" before any real code. This allows them to redirect the execution of a function cleanly. This may be an option as well. The key thing to remember is that the application isn't ""running"", all it's threads are in the stopped state. So as far as the process is concerned any modifications the debugger makes are entirely atomic. Of course, this is all speculation ;) ",c++

How do you detect low memory situations within the java virtual machine?,"I suggest that a better question is ""Why is my application running out of memory?""

When should I use primitives instead of wrapping objects?,"yes, primitives are faster than objects. Since java 5 you can even mix primitives and objects without manually converting one to another. The autoboxing mechanism takes care of just that. this means that if you put a primitive in a collection, the compiler will not complain, and convert the primitive to an object implicitly. ",java
How can I wrap a method so that I can kill its execution if it exceeds a specified timeout?,"I'm assuming the use of multiple threads in the following statements. I've done some reading in this area and most authors say that it's a bad idea to kill another thread.   If the function that you want to kill can be designed to periodically check a variable or synchronization primitive, and then terminate cleanly if that variable or synchronization primitive is set, that would be pretty clean.  Then some sort of monitor thread can sleep for a number of milliseconds and then set the variable or synchronization primitive. ",java

What are some useful PHP Idioms?,"My experience with PHP has taught me a few things. To name a few: Always output errors. These are the first two lines of my typical project (in development mode): ini_set('display_errors', '1'); error_reporting(E_ALL); Never use automagic. Stuff like autoLoad may bite you in the future. Always require dependent classes using require_once. That way you can be sure you'll have your dependencies straight. Use if(isset($array[$key])) instead of if($array[$key]). The second will raise a warning if the key isn't defined. When defining variables (even with for cycles) give them verbose names ($listIndex instead of $j) Comment, comment, comment. If a particular snippet of code doesn't seem obvious, leave a comment. Later on you might need to review it and might not remember what it's purpose is. Other than that, class, function and variable naming conventions are up to you and your team. Lately I've been using Zend Framework's naming conventions because they feel right to me. Also, and when in development mode, I set an error handler that will output an error page at the slightest error (even warnings), giving me the full backtrace. ",php

If both operands are integers the division operation is an integer division, otherwise it is a floating-point division. As for the overflow question, there is no need to explicitly cast, as the compiler implicitly does that for you: #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;limits&gt; using namespace std; int main() {     signed int a = numeric_limits&lt;signed int&gt;::max();     unsigned int b = a + 1; // implicit cast, no overflow here     cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt;  b &lt;&lt; endl;     return 0; } ",c++

Where to get more information on Dictionary ADT and Skip List for Java?,"Since it sounds like you're in an algorithms class, I would separate the implementation of a dictionary and a skip list from what is provided by the Java API. At this point, it's more important that you understand the concept of what these abstract data types are, because they can be implemented in any language (C#, PHP, Scheme, Brainfuck, etc.) Your instructor will probably want you to: first, define the interface or contract for a dictionary (or a skip list), and then figure out its implementation. If you're programming in Java, use JUnit to verify the correctness of your algorithms. If you're programming in some other language, look for any xUnit API. Look in NIST's Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures as a secondary resource to your textbook to understand what these things mean. Probably the best algorithm book in Java is Sedgewick's, and its main distinctive is its pedagogical use of applets. Since the sample code is not written in idiomatic Java, I wouldn't look there for industrial-strength implementations of the algorithms. After all, you're supposed to do the work yourself, not use someone else's collections API. Oh, btw, Java 6 has two implementations of skip lists: ConcurrentSkipListSet and ConcurrentSkipListMap. And the interface of a dictionary data structure in Java is Map. ",java

How to convert CString and ::std::string  ::std::wstring to each other?,"According to CodeGuru: CString to std::string: CString cs(""Hello""); std::string s((LPCTSTR)cs); BUT: std::string cannot always construct from a LPCTSTR. i.e. the code will fail for UNICODE builds. As std::string can construct only from LPSTR / LPCSTR, a programmer who uses VC++ 7.x or better can utilize conversion classes such as CT2CA as an intermediary. CString cs (""Hello""); // Convert a TCHAR string to a LPCSTR CT2CA pszConvertedAnsiString (cs); // construct a std::string using the LPCSTR input std::string strStd (pszConvertedAnsiString); std::string to CString: (From Visual Studio's CString FAQs...) std::string s(""Hello""); CString cs(s.c_str()); CStringT can construct from both character or wide-character strings. i.e. It can convert from char* (i.e. LPSTR) or from wchar_t* (LPWSTR). In other words, char-specialization (of CStringT) i.e. CStringA, wchar_t-specilization CStringW, and TCHAR-specialization CString can be constructed from either char or wide-character, null terminated (null-termination is very important here) string sources. Althoug IInspectable amends the ""null-termination"" part in the comments:   NUL-termination is not required.   CStringT has conversion constructors that take an explicit length argument.

How do I set an image for some but not all nodes in a TreeView?,"I tried this once and I don't think it is possible.

OffTopic: Would you consider HTML + CSS + Webserver to be MVC?,"I would agree, although one can argue about the controller. Jeff illustrates that point in his post, with ZenGarden With: Model = HTML   View = CSS     Controller = Browser (which is more 'front-end' than the web-server) Actually, this is a valid perspective from the client-side. From the server side (a server more complex than a simple html-page server), MVC would be different. With ASP.Net for instance; Model = all of your application logic that is not contained in a view or a controller. The model should contain all of your application business logic and database access logic. For example, if you are using LINQ to SQL to access your database, then you would create your LINQ to SQL classes (your dbml file) in the Models folder View = HTML markup and content that is sent to the browser, plus scripts Controller = responsible for controlling the way that a user interacts with an MVC application. A controller determines what response to send back to a user when a user makes a browser request.A controller is just a class (for example, a Visual Basic or C# class). That is a services-ide perspective of MVC ",html

Parallel quicksort: recursion using Boost Bind?,"Boost bind more or less creates a functor that when called, will call the function you want with the arguments you want. In this case you are creating the functor but never calling it. Try: boost::bind( &amp;Quicksort, Array, Left, pivotNewIndex - 1 )(); boost::bind( &amp;Quicksort, Array, pivotNewIndex + 1, Right )(); Im guessing the first argument is what is messing it up. I think bind requires arguments to be copyable, and references aren't really, it is probably creating a copy and passing the reference to that, which is why nothing is changing. Try: boost::bind( &amp;Quicksort, boost::ref(Array), Left, pivotNewIndex - 1 )(); boost::bind( &amp;Quicksort, boost::ref(Array), pivotNewIndex + 1, Right )(); It would help to know what fVec is and why you aren't passing a pointer to the array of whatever you are sorting. Also note that this method of threading is likely to not give very much speedup because as you get to very small sorts the overhead of starting and scheduling a new thread is much larger than the benefit (plus you will be creating massive numbers of threads which is bad). What you really want is a threadpool that operates on some optimum size chunk or larger and has a fixed number of threads. When sizes smaller than the limit are reached, it does everything serially (and for smaller still you would obviously want to change from quicksort to insertion sort). Also note that the order you are joining leads to serial execution anyways... you want to join both threads after you start both threads. ",c++
How can I call Perl from Java?,"Inline-Java is the usual library to call java from Perl, and this post propose a org.perl.java module which should allow calling Perl from Java, as asked. However, because of the unpredictability of the JNI implementations for different JVMs it is difficult to say what combinations of JVM and Perl will work. Typically, what is required is Perl with MULTIPLICITY, and threads compiled in. That means he uses a custom built Perl. Otherwise, Inline::Java::Callback allows you to call Perl functions from Java. To do this you need to create an org.perl.inline.java.InlinePerlCaller object.

Is there a guide to path referencing in PHP?,"it's probably easier to just use an absolute path to reference: set_include_path('/path/to/files'); this way you have a reference point for all your future includes. includes are handled relative to the point they were called, which can cause a bit of confusion in certain scenarios. as an example, given a sample folder structure (/home/files): index.php test/   test.php test2/   test2.php // /home/files/index.php include('test/test.php'); // /home/files/test/test.php include('../test2/test2.php'); if you call index.php, it will try to include the following files: /home/files/test/test.php // expected /home/test2/test2.php // maybe not expected which may not be what you expect. calling test.php will call /home/files/test2/test.php as expected. the conclusion being, the includes will be relative to the original calling point. to clarify, this affects set_include_path() if it is relative as well. consider the following (using the same directory structure): &lt;?php // location: /home/files/index.php    set_include_path('../'); // our include path is now /home/    include('files/test/test.php'); // try to include /home/files/test/test.php    include('test2/test2.php'); // try to include /home/test2/test2.php    include('../test3.php'); // try to include /test3.php ?&gt; ",php

How can I override the OnBeforeUnload dialog and replace it with my own?,"You can't modify the default dialogue for onbeforeunload, so your best bet may be to work with it. window.onbeforeunload = function() {     return 'You have unsaved changes!'; } Here's a reference to this from Microsoft:   When a string is assigned to the returnValue property of window.event, a dialog box appears that gives users the option to stay on the current page and retain the string that was assigned to it. The default statement that appears in the dialog box, ""Are you sure you want to navigate away from this page? ...

What are the benefits to marking a field as `readonly` in C#?,"The readonly keyword is used to declare a member variable a constant, but allows the value to be calculated at runtime.  This differs from a constant declared with the const modifier, which must have its value set at compile time.  Using readonly you can set the value of the field either in the declaration, or in the constructor of the object that the field is a member of. Also use it if you don't want to have to recompile external DLLs that reference the constant (since it gets replaced at compile time). ",c#

How do you organise your STL headers?,"I only include the header files that are really needed in every source, and not 'catch all' headers, to keep dependencies (and hence compile times) as low as possible.

So even if something gets declared via the included precompiled headers, I still include the 'regular' header, which will get skipped by the include guard mechanism and won't add anything significant to the compile times. As precompiled headers are a compiler specific thing. Optimizing / changing precompiled headers should have no effect on the correct functioning of the code in my opinion.  The main advantage of having dependencies as low as possible is that refactoring gets easier (or rather: feasible) Great book on all this is Large Scale C++ Design from Lakos ",c++

Can Boost Spirit be used to parse byte stream data?,"Boost Spirit allows for a parser to be defined using Extended BackusâNaur Form (EBNF) syntax with template meta-programming. It is very flexible and uses abstract classes in all phases of the parsing process that can be customized. In order to process a binary data stream, you would need to implement custom scanner classes since the default types are tailored for text input. You can read further in The Scanner and Parsing section of the Spirit User's Guide. In my humble opinion, binary data streams are best handled with hand rolled serialization code. Spirit is geared more towards well formed grammars like mark-up or scripting languages. For example, The Complete Syntax of Lua is provided in EBNF. So, it might make sense to use Spirit to build a custom parser. On the other hand, a proprietary serial data link with synchronization bytes and CRC bracketing messages would require a lot more work just to define the EBNF if a context-free grammar even exists for it. Addendum The latest version of Boost Spirit includes functionality for dealing with binary data. ",c++

It sets the failbit because getline tries to extract characters from the stream. If there are no characters left (and no '\n' has been seen yet), stream.get(c) to a character will set the failbit. Then getline will set the eofbit and then .eof() will return true, and your loop exits. If you don't want failbit set, then change your condition from !stream.eof() to stream.peek() != EOF (and make sure there is a trailing newline in your file). This now is also the solution to your problem: .close() doesn't .clear() your stream, so the failbit still is set if you reopen your file. call stream.clear() after reading your stuff in, and then it works.

How best can I isolate my application from an unreliable database?,"I have seen this issue a few times, normally with a vendor database.

In this way the database performance issues will no longer affect the SOAP service. This solution does, however, come at the cost of increased complexity. Note that a .NET web service can be called by, and respond asynchronously to, its clients. I'm not sure if that's possible with a Java SOAP service.

How do I get the mouse button pressed from a command event in XUL?,"The main thing to keep in mind is that oncommand is fired for any action that results in an activation of the button which can include pressing the space bar when the button has the focus, using a keyboard shortcut attached to the button, or clicking the button with the mouse. The event handler is not really supposed to care how it was called, only that it was. (I imagine this was a conscious decision to keep a consistent user interface.) The only actions that result in the button property being added to the Event object are  onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, and onmouseup. You'll note that even if you disable your onclick button, the event still fires whereas with oncommand it won't. To get the same functionality as oncommand, you'd need to handle both onclick and onkeydown events yourself while making sure the button is still enabled. You also might be able to create a custom button using XBL which have custom events like onleftclick or onmiddleclick that then fall back to oncommand if they are not set--but I've not tried it.

How can I achieve uploading same files as a batch using jQuery?,"I think you are asking how to make it so no two files in a list of file upload boxes are the same, so you don't accidentally upload the same file twice. This could be easily done using the input.onchange event.  When you add a new file input box, assign its onchange event to a function like this one: function fileChanged() {         $(createFileInput()).insertAfter(this).wrap('&lt;p&gt;' + '&lt;/p&gt;').change(fileChanged);         if(!isFileUnique(this))         {             $(this).remove();             alert('You already chose to upload this file.\nPlease choose a different file.');             return false;         }         return true; } Use some helper functions: function isFileUnique(input) {     if(input.value == '')         return true;     var fileInputs = $(input).parents('form').find('input:file');     var sameInputs = $.grep(fileInputs, function(item, index) {         if(item == input)             return false;         if(item.value == input.value)             return true;         return false;     });     return sameInputs.length == 0; } function createFileInput() {     var input = document.createElement('input');     input.type = 'file';     return input; } Things are a little complicated because you can't do a mere ""this.value = '';""  So we just delete ""this"" and create a new input field.  We need to create a new one anyway (so the user can upload an extra file), so it the issue is counteracted. (Return values for fileChanged aren't needed, because I don't think file inputs will allow Javascript to ignore the change command.) ",jquery
What is a partial class?,"A partial type (it doesn't have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files.

"Firefox CSS: Given 2 divs, how can I float the *second* one to the right using static positioning?","You shouldn't need position: absolute; on your right hand div, nor the right: 0; positioning. Floating the div right next to another one floated left (and with the margin set as you have) they should end up at either side of the browser window with the left hand div expanding to fill the available space (apart from the 10px gap created by your margin). When you ""absolutely"" position an object you are effectively removing it from the normal flow of the document and it will no longer occupy any space (nor will it ""push"" other objects around). I suspect that simply removing the positioning from the right hand div whilst keeping clear: both;  on the footer will fix your problem. You may also need to swap the order of left and right hand divs in the source code, so that the float: right; item comes before the float: left; item. Good luck!  P.S.

Imitating SQL Server Profiler in a C# app?,"Are you wanting this to be real-time, just like the Profiler itself? That'd be tough to do. You'd basically be re-creating the profiler.  If that is not a requirement, I would recommend simply calling the sp_trace_create stored procs that you found to start a server-side trace, then use your application to open up the files that this trace produces. The EASIEST way to learn how this works is to run the SQL Profiler itself, set all the options you want, then click Run, and immediately click Stop. Then go to File, Export, Script Trace Definition, and choose the appropriate version. This should give you a TSQL script that puts all the correct pieces together, including all the trace events, columns, etc. More technical history of the profiler: This old SQLMag article has some history of the Profiler, which replaced an app called ""SQL Trace"" when SQL 7.0 was introduced.

What are the differences between various threading synchronization options in C#?,"Great question. I maybe wrong.. Let me try.. Revision#2 of my orig answer.. with a little bit of more understanding. Thanks for making me read :) lock(obj)  is a CLR construct that for (intra-object?) thread synchronization. Ensures that only one thread can take ownership of the object's lock &amp; enter the locked block of code. Other threads must wait till the current owner relinquishes the lock by exiting the block of code. Also it is recommended that you lock on a private member object of your class. Monitors  lock(obj) is implemented internally using a Monitor. You should prefer lock(obj) because it prevents you from goofing up like forgetting the cleanup procedure. It 'idiot-proof's the Monitor construct if you will. Using Monitor is generally preferred over mutexes, because monitors were designed specifically for the .NET Framework and therefore make better use of resources. Using a lock or monitor is useful for preventing the simultaneous execution of thread-sensitive blocks of code, but these constructs do not allow one thread to communicate an event to another. This requires synchronization events, which are objects that have one of two states, signaled and un-signaled, that can be used to activate and suspend threads.  Mutex, Semaphores are OS-level concepts. e.g with a named mutex you could synchronize across multiple (managed) exes (ensuring that only one instance of your application is running on the machine.)   Mutex:  Unlike monitors, however, a mutex can be used to synchronize threads across processes. When used for inter-process synchronization, a mutex is called a named mutex because it is to be used in another application, and therefore it cannot be shared by means of a global or static variable. It must be given a name so that both applications can access the same mutex object. In contrast, the Mutex class is a wrapper to a Win32 construct. While it is more powerful than a monitor, a mutex requires interop transitions that are more computationally expensive than those required by the Monitor class.  Semaphores (hurt my brain). Use the Semaphore class to control access to a pool of resources. Threads enter the semaphore by calling the WaitOne method, which is inherited from the WaitHandle class, and release the semaphore by calling the Release method. The count on a semaphore is decremented each time a thread enters the semaphore, and incremented when a thread releases the semaphore. When the count is zero, subsequent requests block until other threads release the semaphore. When all threads have released the semaphore, the count is at the maximum value specified when the semaphore was created.  A thread can enter the semaphore multiple times..The Semaphore class does not enforce thread identity on WaitOne or Release.. programmers responsibility to not muck up. Semaphores are of two types: local semaphores and named system semaphores. If you create a Semaphore object using a constructor that accepts a name, it is associated with an operating-system semaphore of that name. Named system semaphores are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. A local semaphore exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the local Semaphore object. Each Semaphore object is a separate local semaphore.

Try this inside of clickTest function: alert(this.id); This will refer to the DOM element that fired the event. Basically, there isn't really a way to pass parameters to an event handler function.  The reason for that is that the browser is executing the function based on an event and you are not actually calling the function.

Also when defining an image I recommend you also specify the width &amp; hight in decipoints, this should help with the scaling of the image (*r3A) on the page so add this (just after your resolution command should be an okay place for it): Int32 deciHeight = original.Height / (int)original.HorizontalResolution * 720; Int32 deciWidth = original.Width / (int)original.VerticalResolution * 720; stream(""\u001b*t{0:d}h{1:d}V"", deciHeight, deciWidth)); The other recommendation is to write all of this to file (watch your encodings) and use one of the handful of PCL viewers to view your data vs. always printing it.  Should save you some time and a forest or two!  I've tried all of them and wold recommend spending the $89 and purchasing pclWorks.

How do I perform a Unit Test using threads?,"Concurrency is one of those things that are very difficult to unit test. If you are just trying to test that the code inside each thread is doing what it is supposed to test, may be you should just test this code isolated of the context.   If in this example the threads collaborate to reach a result, may be you can test that collaboration without using threads. That would be done by executing all the collaborative parts sequentially.  If you want to test for race conditions and these kind of things, unit testing is not the best way. You will get tests that sometimes fail and sometimes donÂ´t fail.  To summarize, I think that may be your problem is that you are unit testing in a level too high.  Hope this helps ",java
Why doesn't this generic interface stack work?,"IElementList needs to implement Iterable&lt;E&gt;. Otherwise, the interface specifies Iterator iterator(), not Iterator&lt;E&gt; iterator().

How safe is Greasemonkey?,"Considering that GreaseMonkey allows you to let random people on the Internet change the behavior of your favorite websites, how safe can it be? It's as safe as you allow it to be - but you aren't very clear, so let's look at it from a few perspectives: Web Developer Greasemonkey can't do anything to your website that a person with telnet can't already do to your website.  It automates things a bit, but other than that if greasemonkey is a security hole, then your website design is flawed - not greasemonkey. Internet user with Greasemonkey loaded Like anything else you load on your system, greasemonkey can be used against you.  Don't load scripts onto your system unless you trust the source (in both meanings of the term 'source').  It's fairly limited and sandboxed, but that doesn't mean it's safe, merely that it's harder for someone to do something nefarious.

Greasemonkey does not alter the websites you visit unless you've loaded it on your system.

Does Java work with PCF fonts?,"I've spent all morning learning about Java fonts.  There's a lot of limitations, some of which are removed in Java 1.6.  I don't have any answers, but here is some information I have that might be helpful. Java distinguishes internally between system fonts and created fonts.  (News flash to Sun: it'd be nice to make that clear through subclassing!)  The system fonts seem to be fonts installed in the JRE possibly plus some of the fonts installed on your system.  But apparently not all of the fonts installed on your system; I, too, have adobe-helvetica on my Linux system but it doesn't seem to be accessible from Java under any name I can think of. Meanwhile, you can create fonts from a font file with the Font.createFont() method.  You have to specify the font file type.  The only constants I found to specify these types in the Font class are TRUETYPE_FONT and TYPE1_FONT.  So it looks like if PCF fonts are available, it isn't made explicit through providing a constant to specify them.  Maybe somebody else knows more.  I did see some information online about using bitmap fonts in Java ME, so it must somehow be possible to use other types of fonts. Once you have a created font, you can add it to the JVM's concept of available fonts with the GraphicsEnvironment.registerFont() call, but that is only available on Java 1.6 and later. ",java

After messing with this some, it appears that v.front() and v.begin() are likely inlined and GDB isn't finding them.  I'll keep looking, but personally I would simply add the line int* i = &amp;v[0] to the source file, and then use GDB commands on i while debugging.

Monitoring a displays state in python?,"It seems that, when Windows wants to start the screen saver or turn the monitor off, it will send a WM_SYSCOMMAND to the topmost window with a wParam of SC_SCREENSAVE (to start the screen saver) or a wParam of SC_MONITORPOWER and a lParam of 1 or 2 (to turn the monitor off). This message will then be passed to DefWindowProc, which will actually do the action. So, if your window happens to be the topmost one, you can intercept these events and ignore them (or do anything else you want before passing them to DefWindowProc). On Windows Vista, there seems to be a more intuitive, and more reliable, way to know the monitor power state. You call RegisterPowerSettingNotification to tell the system to send your window a WM_POWERBROADCAST message with a wParam of PBT_POWERSETTINGCHANGE and a lParam pointing to a POWERBROADCAST_SETTING structure. I cannot test either of them since I currently do not have any computer with Windows nearby. I hope, however, they point you in the right direction.

Can you enable [Authorize] for controller but disable it for a single action?,"I don't think you can do this with the standard Authorize attribute, but you could derive your own attribute from AuthorizeAttribute that takes a list of actions to allow and allows access to just those actions.  You can look at the source for the AuthorizeAttribute at www.codeplex.com for ideas on how to do this.  If you did, it might look like: [AdminAuthorize (Roles = ""Administrator"", Exempt = ""Login, Logout"") ] public class AdminController : Controller {     public ActionResult Login()     {         return View();     }     public ActionResult Login()     {         return View();     }     ... other, restricted actions ... } EDIT:  FYI, I eventually ran across a need to do something similar on my own and I went a different direction.  I created a default authorization filter provider and apply a global authorize filter.  The authorization filter provider uses reflection to check if an action or controller has a specific authorize attribute applied and, if so, defers to it.  Otherwise, it applies a default authorization filter.  This is coupled with a PublicAttribute derived from AuthorizeAttribute that allows public access.  Now, I get default secured access, but can grant public access via [Public] applied to an action or controller.  More specific authorization can also be applied as necessary.

"How to fix ""Referenced assembly does not have a strong name"" error?","To avoid this error you could either: Load the assembly dynamically, or Sign the third-party assembly.  You will find instructions on signing third-party assemblies in .NET-fu: Signing an Unsigned Assembly (Without Delay Signing).  Signing Third-Party Assemblies The basic principle to sign a thirp-party is to  Disassemble the assembly using ildasm.exe and save the intermediate language (IL): ildasm /all /out=thirdPartyLib.il thirdPartyLib.dll  Rebuild and sign the assembly: ilasm /dll /key=myKey.snk thirdPartyLib.il Fixing Additional References The above steps work fine unless your third-party assembly (A.dll) references another library (B.dll) which also has to be signed. You can disassemble, rebuild and sign both A.dll and B.dll using the commands above, but at runtime, loading of B.dll will fail because A.dll was originally built with a reference to the unsigned version of B.dll.  The fix to this issue is to patch the IL file generated in step 1 above. You will need to add the public key token of B.dll to the reference. You get this token by calling  sn -Tp B.dll  which will give you the following output: Microsoft (R) .NET Framework Strong Name Utility  Version 4.0.30319.33440 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

Parallelization: What causes Java threads to block other than synchronization & I/O?,"All graphics operations run on a single thread in swing. If they are rendering to the screen they will effectively be contending for access to this thread. If you are running on Windows, all graphics operations run on a single thread no matter what. Other operating systems have similar limitations. It's actually fairly difficult to get the proper granularity of threaded workers sometimes, and sometimes it's easy to make them too big or too small, which will typically give you  less than 100% usage of all cores. If you're not rendering much gui, the most likely culprit is that you're contending more than you think for some shared resource. This is easily seen with profiler tools like jprofiler. Some VM's like bea's jrockit can even tell you this straight out of the box. This is one of those places where you dont want to act on guesswork. Get a profiler! ",java
How to design a simple C++ object factory?,"You could implement an object factory with static methods that return an instance of a Manager-Class. In the factory you could create a method for the default type of manager and a method for any type of manager which you give an argument representing the type of the Manager-Class (say with an enum). This last method should return an Interface rather than a Class. Edit: I'll try to give some code, but mind that my C++ times are quite a while back and I'm doing only Java and some scripting for the time being. class Manager { // aka Interface     public: virtual void someMethod() = 0; }; class Manager1 : public Manager {     void someMethod() { return null; } }; class Manager2 : public Manager {     void someMethod() { return null; } }; enum ManagerTypes {     Manager1, Manager2 }; class ManagerFactory {     public static Manager* createManager(ManagerTypes type) {         Manager* result = null;         switch (type) {         case Manager1:              result = new Manager1();              break;         case Manager2:              result = new Manager2();              break;         default:              // Do whatever error logging you want              break;         }         return result;      }  }; Now you should be able to call the Factory via (if you've been able to make the code sample work): Manager* manager = ManagerFactory.createManager(ManagerTypes.Manager1); ",c++

How do I find the type of the object instance of the caller of the current function?,"   Is there anyone who can show me how to implement a zero argument CreateLog() that gets the name from the subclass and not the declaring class? I don't think you'll be able to do it by looking at the stack frame.  While your class is IMReceiver, the call to CreateLog method is in the MessageReceiver class. The stack frame must tell you where the method is being called from, or it wouldn't be any use, so it's always going to say MessageReceiver If you called CreateLog explicitly in your IMReceiver and other classes, then it works, as the stack frame shows the method being called in the derived class (because it actually is). Here's the best thing I can come up with: class BaseClass{   public Log log = Utils.CreateLog(); } class DerivedClass : BaseClass {   public DerivedClass() {     log = Utils.CreateLog();   } } If we trace creation of logs, we get this: new BaseClass(); # Log created for BaseClass new DerivedClass(); # Log created for BaseClass # Log created for DerivedClass The second 'log created for derived class' overwrites the instance variable, so your code will behave correctly, you'll just be creating a BaseClass log which immediately gets thrown away. This seems hacky and bad to me, I'd just go with specifying the type parameter in the constructor or using a generic.  IMHO specifying the type is cleaner than poking around in the stack frame anyway If you can get it without looking at the stack frame, your options expand considerably ",c#
How to Create a Listener for WCF ServiceHost events when service is hosted under IIS?,"The whole point of WCF services and IIS hosting is to achieve scalability and allow easy hosting. Although you could connect to events exposed by the ServiceHostBase class (see here), I would recommend against it and analyzing if you really need those shared resources. The main reasons for asking you to re-think are: shared resources need to be thread safe (IIS can serve many requests simultaneously), so this creates a bottleneck for the scalability of your application and secondly, it's best if your services are stateless, and this includes (I guess) the usage of share resources (or application wide resources).

How Can I Create Rounded Rectangle Buttons in WM6?,"Getting pretty buttons like that is typically done by doing a complete owner-drawn button and drawing an image that a graphic designer created to it rather than letting GDI do any of the control painting.

To get the nice ""rounded"" effects, you simply create the image with a background color that you then use as a transparency color. Tee scaling issue is somewhat unique to WinMo, since iPhone really has only one resolution.  If you need to target different resolution WinMo devices you can do one of 2 things (which you use depends on the images you're using).

How to disable a select box not inside a form?,"Short answer: No, you don't need to have the select box within a form.  Where is your JavaScript currently included with respect to the body tag in your HTML? Remember that if you have inline JavaScript included in the head if your page, then it will fire as the page is loaded. At this point, the select box will not have been parsed and, thus, your code cannot access it in order to disable it. I'm no fan of mixing JavaScript and markup together, but this demo should work for all intents and purposes. &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Select Demo&lt;/title&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;     &lt;select id=""mySelect"" onchange=""updateChoice();""&gt;     	&lt;option value=""1""&gt;First&lt;/option&gt;     	&lt;option value=""2"" selected=""""&gt;Second&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;/select&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;      document.getElementById('mySelect').disabled = true;  &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; If, for whatever reason, you have to keep the script located in the page rather than an external file, you could setup an event handler to perform the same functionality after the page has loaded.

"Is there a ""nice"" way to deal with reassembling multicasts from multiple sources?","It doesn't sound like you've given enough information for detailed answers, but there are a few general pointers to consider for realtime handling of multicast data. If you're using raw UDP multicast, you're probably doing some sort of protocol sequencing in userspace in order to deal with lost or duplicated packets.  Whatever optimizations you want to do, resist the temptation to break the layering between your application and your protocol layer. std::vector, for most purposes, is identical to a raw dynamically-allocated character buffer.  Don't shy away from using it just because it's an abstraction layer.  There are two cases where you should avoid it, however: If you can get away with statically-allocated buffers If you need to transfer ownership of the buffer downstream (though if you design carefuly, swap() may be sufficient) Preallocation is your friend.  If you can have a set of buffers available for usage when data comes in, you can remove most dynamic allocation from the fast path of execution. Minimize memory copies.  If you can process data in a single call stack, you have a chance to avoid copies.  If you have to pass data off to a different thread, you may be forced to copy data. If your application can handle chunked buffers (rather than aggregating all data into a single buffer), look into writev and readv. I don't believe any canned solution will solve your problems.  Boost ASIO, libevent, etc. will all handle socket abstractions for you, but what you do with your data is still your responsibility, once it's been delivered. ",c++

"What do 1.#INF00, -1.#IND00 and -1.#IND mean?","From IEEE floating-point exceptions in C++ :   This page will answer the following questions.         My program just printed out 1.#IND or 1.#INF (on Windows) or nan or inf (on Linux). What happened?   How can I tell if a number is really a number and not a NaN or an infinity?   How can I find out more details at runtime about kinds of NaNs and infinities?   Do you have any sample code to show how this works?   Where can I learn more?         These questions have to do with floating point exceptions. If you get some strange non-numeric output where you're expecting a number, you've either exceeded the finite limits of floating point arithmetic or you've asked for some result that is undefined. To keep things simple, I'll stick to working with the double floating point type. Similar remarks hold for float types.      Debugging 1.#IND, 1.#INF, nan, and inf      If your operation would generate a larger positive number than could be stored in a double, the operation will return 1.#INF on Windows or inf on Linux. Similarly your code will return -1.#INF or -inf if the result would be a negative number too large to store in a double. Dividing a positive number by zero produces a positive infinity and dividing a negative number by zero produces a negative infinity. Example code at the end of this page will demonstrate some operations that produce infinities.      Some operations don't make mathematical sense, such as taking the square root of a negative number. (Yes, this operation makes sense in the context of complex numbers, but a double represents a real number and so there is no double to represent the result.) The same is true for logarithms of negative numbers. Both sqrt(-1.0) and log(-1.0) would return a NaN, the generic term for a ""number"" that is ""not a number"". Windows displays a NaN as  -1.#IND (""IND"" for ""indeterminate"") while Linux displays nan. Other operations that would return a NaN include 0/0, 0*â, and â/â. See the sample code below for examples.       In short, if you get 1.#INF or inf, look for overflow or division by zero. If you get 1.#IND or nan, look for illegal operations. Maybe you simply have a bug. If it's more subtle and you have something that is difficult to compute, see  Avoiding Overflow, Underflow, and Loss of Precision. That article gives tricks for computing results that have intermediate steps overflow if computed directly. ",c++

Consider: template&lt;template &lt;class T&gt; class U&gt; // must be ""class"" std::string to_string(const U&lt;char&gt;&amp; u) {   return std::string(u.begin(),u.end()); } The only other thing you can put in place of the class or typename keywords is an integral type. For example: template&lt;std::size_t max&gt; class Foo{...}; ... Foo&lt;10&gt; f; For a concrete example of this, take a look at std::bitset&lt;N&gt; in the standard library. ",c++

Ideally when you use exceptions you're using them in exceptional circumstances - that is, should no longer be concerned with performance, but rather with fixing the problem (rare) or failing fast and notifying the user / logging / etc. Edit: JaredPar mentioned a great quote regarding this that I feel is important enough to repeat: ""If you're worried about Exception performance, you're using them incorrectly.""

Does a truststore need the sub-ca certificate?,"The trust store should only contain the root CAs, not intermediates. An identity store should contain private keys, each associated with its certificate chain, except for the root. Many, many applications in the wild are misconfigured, and when trying to identify themselves (say, a server authenticating itself with SSL), they only send their own certificate, and are missing the intermediates. There are fewer that mistakenly send the root as part of the chain, but this is less harmful. Most certificate path builders will just ignore it, and find a path to a root from their trusted key store. The suppositions in the original question are right on target. ",java

Keep in mind that this isn't something you can know statically (as with PRETTY_FUNCTION); you actually have to walk the stack to figure out what function called you.

How do I replace an Int property with an Enum in Entity Framework?,"Indirectly, like so.

You could equally leave it internal, and have some methods in the context to do the filtering... here's one I wrote earlier today: public IOrderedQueryable&lt;User&gt; Administrators {     get { return Users.Where(x =&gt; x.DbUserType == User.UserTypeAdmin)              .OrderBy(x =&gt; x.Name); } where User.UserTypeAdmin is my internal constant.

HowTo Multicast a Stream Captured with DirectShow?,"To achieve that you need to setup/write some kind of video streaming server. I've used VideoCapX for the same purpose on my project. The documentation and support is not top notch, but it's good enough. It's using WMV streaming technology. The stream is called MMS stream. You can view it with any most media player. I've tested with Windows Media Player, Media Player Classics and VLC. If you would like to see it's capability without writing any code just yet, take a look at U-Broadcast, it uses VideoCapX to do the job behind the scene. I've been using DirectShow.Net for almost 2 years, and I still find it hard to write a streaming server myself, due to the complexity of DirectShow technology. Other than WMV, you can take a look at Helix Server or Apple Streaming Server. The latter one is not free, so is WMV Streaming Server from Microsoft. You can also take a look at VLC or Windows Media Encoder to do streaming straight from the application. But so far I find U-Broadcast out do both of the above. VLC has some compatibility issue with codec and playback from non VLC player, WME has problem with starting up capturing device.

It should never be used as an integral part of your site, but as a piece of content within a site. Usually, if you can do it without an iframe, that is a better option. I'm sure others here may have more information or more specific examples, it all comes down to the problem you are trying to solve.

late static binding: which languages commonly used for web development support it?,"I completely misunderstood the what late static binding is. Here's what Wikipedia says.   Late static binding is a variant of   [name] binding somewhere between static and   dynamic binding. Consider the   following PHP example: class A { 	static $word = ""hello""; 	static function hello() {print self::$word;} } class B extends A { 	static $word = ""bye""; } B::hello();   Without late static binding, the PHP   interpreter binds the function hello()   to class A when the programmer is   clearly expressing the function on   class B. The absence of late static   binding would cause ""hello"" to be   printed, not ""bye"" despite hello()   being called on class B.      Late static   binding in the interpreter means that   $word is determined at runtime. In   this case it would reference B::$word   if B::hello() is called and A::$word   if A::hello() is called. This does   require a change in keywords from   self to static (possibly available   beginning with PHP 5.3) in A::hello() class A { 	static $word = ""Welcome""; 	static function hello() {print static::$word;} } class B extends A { 	static $word = ""bye""; } B::hello(); ",php

How do I respond to mouse clicks on sprites in PyGame?,"I usually give my clickable objects a click function, like in your example. I put all of those objects in a list, for easy iteration when the click functions are to be called. when checking for which mousebutton you press, use the button property of the event. import pygame from pygame.locals import * #This lets you use pygame's constants directly. for event in pygame.event.get():     if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:  #Better to seperate to a new if statement aswell, since there's more buttons that can be clicked and makes for cleaner code.         if event.button == 1:             for object in clickableObjectsList:                 object.clickCheck(event.pos) I would say this is the recommended way of doing it. The click only registers once, so it wont tell your sprite if the user is ""dragging"" with a button. That can easily be done with a boolean that is set to true with the MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event, and false with the MOUSEBUTTONUP. The have ""draggable"" objects iterated for activating their functions... and so on. However, if you don't want to use an event handler, you can let an update function check for input with: pygame.mouse.get_pos()  pygame.mouse.get_pressed(). This is a bad idea for larger projects, since it can create hard to find bugs. Better just keeping events in one place. Smaller games, like simple arcade games might make more sense using the probing style though. ",python

C++ experts: is the offset of a member variable to its class constant under these conditions?,"I'm no expert but i gonna try answering you anyway :)  FooClass is a non-POD type. This mean it could have more than one sections of private, public or protected. Within such a section, the order is that of the definition of the members, but across those sections, order is arbitrary and unspecified.  foo will always point to FooClass. Well so we have guarantee there is no offset adjustment done. At least in one compilation, offsets will be the same then (don't have the backing up Standard quote. But it can't work if they were different). We only care about behavior on a single compiler. Well since the order of members is unspecified across sections of access modifiers and the compiler is allowed to put padding between members, this won't buy us much. We only care about objects on the stack (automatic storage duration). Well i don't see how that changes anything of the object layout. So after all i don't think you have any guarantee that the offset will be constant across compilations. For considerations within one compilation (so if we would play with a compiler whose generated code uses an ABI that changes with each different compilation), the offset just can't be different. But even if you know the offset, you can't access the member. Your only way to access a member is using the member access operator -&gt; and . (that's said in 9.2/9).  Why not use data member pointers? They allow accessing members safely. Here is an example: (looking up members by name). ",c++
"Using Python's ctypes to pass/read a parameter declared as ""struct_name *** param_name""?","A const SANE_Device *** is a three-level pointer: it's a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a constant SANE_Device.  You can use the program cdecl to decipher complicated C/C++ type definitions. According to the SANE documentation, SANE_get_devices() will store a pointer to a NULL-terminated list of pointers to SANE devices if successful.  Thus, the proper way to call it is to declare a variable of type const SANE_Device ** (i.e. a pointer to a pointer to a constant `SANE_Device), and pass in the address of that pointer: const SANE_Device **device_list; SANE_get_devices(&amp;device_list, local_only);  // check return value // Now, device_list[0] points to the first device, // device_list[1] points to the second device, etc. // Once you hit a NULL pointer, that's the end of the list: int num_devices = 0; while(device_list[num_devices] != NULL)     num_devices++; // num_devices now stores the total number of devices Now, this is how you would call it from C code.  I've skimmed the documentation on ctypes, and it appears that you want to use the byref function to pass the argument by reference, and that the value you pass should be a POINTER to a POINTER to a SANE_Device.  Note the distinction between pointer and POINTER: the former creates a pointer to an instance, whereas the latter creates a pointer to a type.  Thus, I'm guessing the following code will work: // SANE_Device declared as you had it devices = POINTER(POINTER(SANE_Device))()  // devices is a NULL pointer to a pointer to a SANE_Device status = libsane.sane_get_devices(byref(devices), c_int(0)) if status != successful:   // replace this by whatever success is     print error else:     num_devices = 0     // Convert NULL-terminated C list into Python list     device_list = []     while devices[num_devices]:         device_list.append(devices[num_devices].contents)  // use .contents here since each entry in the C list is itself a pointer         num_devices += 1     print device_list [Edit] I've tested the above code using a very simple placeholder for SANE_get_devices, and it works.

What is the best library for Java to grid/cluster-enable your application?,"There are several: Terracotta (open source, based on Mozilla Public License); Oracle Coherence (formerly Tangosol Coherence; commercial; based on JSR 107, which was never adopted officially); GigaSpaces (commercial; based on JavaSpaces API, part of Jini); GridGain, which you mentioned (open source: LGPL); memcached with a Java client library (open source: BSD License; EHCache (open source: Apache Software License; OSCache (open source: modified Apache License; and no doubt several others. Now I haven't used all of these but I've used or investigated the majority of them. GridGain and GigaSpaces are more centred around grid computing than caching and (imho) best suited to compute grids than data grids (see this explanation of compute vs data grids).  I find GigaSpaces to be a really interesting technology and it has several licensing options, including a free version and a free full version for startups. Coherence and Terracotta try to treat caches as Maps, which is a fairly natural abstraction.  I've used Coherence a lot and it's an excellent high-performance product but not cheap.  Terracotta I'm less familiar with.  The documentation for Coherence I find a bit lacking at times but it really is a powerful product. OSCache I've primarily used as a means of reducing memory usage and fragmentation in Java Web applications as it has a fairly neat  JSP tag.  If you've ever looked at compiled JSPs, you'll see they do a lot of String concatenations.  This tag allows you to effectively cache the results of a segment of JSP code and HTML into a single String, which can hugely improve performance in some cases. EHCache is an easy caching solution that I've also used in Web applications.  Never as a distributed cache though but it can do that.  I tend to view it as a quick and dirty solution but that's perhaps my bias. memcached is particularly prevelent in the PHP world (and used by such sites as Facebook).  It's a really light and easy solution and has the advantage that it doesn't run in the same process and you'll have arguably better interoperability options with other technology stacks, if this is important to you.

For example, assume you have an average coverage of 75% but for one class you have coverage of 80%.  If you remove that 80% class and all of its tests, you reduce the overall coverage percentage even though none of the other code is any less tested than previously. ",java

The same will happen for this which is more obvious: void CallFoo&lt;T&gt;(T x) { x.foo(); } That fails too, because you could pass a type T that wouldn't have a function foo.

PHP to ASP.NET - call_user_func() equivalent?,"To the .NET devs, this is basically a method of calling a method from a given name (as a string).  To the OP: (I think) You have to use reflection. It's nowhere near as pretty and it's quite expensive (IIRC) so it's best not over-used. System.Reflection.MethodInfo method = this.GetType().GetMethod(myMethodName); // method.Invoke(args, null); I think you might possibly be doing things the ""wrong"" way if you have to resort to this to get things done. There's possible a cleaner pattern that will work better. The way I've made plugin-architectures is through globally shared interfaces* so plugins can implement a ""plug-in"" interface* and then I know there is going to be a .DoSomething() (etc) method available. No reflection needed =) *Or Abstract Classes.. Really, whatever fits best! ",php

There are some hints on using RAII-like behaviour in C# online, but most seem to use the finalizer &mdash; which is not deterministic. I think there are some Windows SDK functions to create temporary files, but don't know if they are automatically deleted on program termination.  There is the GetTempPath function, but files there are only deleted when you log out or restart, IIRC. P.S.  The C# destructor documentation says you can and should release resources there, which I find a bit odd.  If so, you could simply delete the tempfile in the destructor, but again, this might not be completely deterministic. ",c#

How to change the row position of virtual mode DataGridView?,"You have to clear the old position and set a new one The collection dataGridView1.SelectedRows has the current selected Rows. Depending on the MultiSelect property of the grid you may have to loop through all the rows in the SelectedRows and mark them as unselected.

How do I avoid unwanted log messages on java project?,"Messages sounds like a class you wrote, because I don't see it in my JDK 6 javadocs.

How do I find the caller of a method using stacktrace or reflection?,"I've done this before.  You can just create a new exception and grab the stack trace on it without throwing it, then examine the stack trace.  As the other answer says though, it's extremely costly--don't do it in a tight loop. I've done it before for a logging utility on an app where performance didn't matter much (Performance rarely matters much at all, actually--as long as you display the result to an action such as a button click quickly).   It was before you could get the stack trace, exceptions just had .printStackTrace() so I had to redirect System.out to a stream of my own creation, then (new Exception()).printStackTrace(); Redirect System.out back and parse the stream.  Fun stuff. ",java
Is endian conversion required for wchar_t data?,"Yes, you need to perform endian conversion.  Define carefully your serialization format, i.e. the byte order of data that is transmitted over the network or stored into a disk file.  Then, when sending data, convert from native to wire format (may or may not require byte swapping), and when receiving data, convert from wire to native format (again may or may not require byte swapping).  You should pick a wire format that will be used by the majority of clients to minimize the average amount of byte swapping. ",c++

How to pass a COM method as a function argument? And Microsoft Compiler error C3867,Looks like a straight c++ problem. Your method expects a pointer to a function. You have a member function - (which is different from a function). Typically you will need to either: 1. Change the function that you want to pass to being static. 2. Change the type of pointer expected to a member function pointer. The syntax for dealing with member function pointers is not the best... A standard trick would be (1) and then pass the object this pointer explicitly as an argument allowing you to then call non static members. ,c++
SQL Server 2000 intermittent connection exceptions on production server - specific environment problem?,"I know you don't want to hear this, but people smarter than I have said it (check out McConnell's Code Complete if you don't believe me): It's probably your code, and your gut is probably correct:   My gut is telling me its ASP.NET - SQL   Server 2000 connection issues.. The Errors being thrown are quite specific, and contextually, they look like they're just trying to connect and having a hard time -- which if it only happens in the client's environment, could be indicative of a setting not set correctly for the VM to access TCP connections on the host machine (under a different instance). Are you sure that none of your code has changed since before the move, and that your previous environment had logging like this enabled?  It may have been happening (to a lesser degree) before, but your environment didn't catch it because you didn't have logging enabled. If that's not the issue, and I'm reading your post correctly:  You're running a server on a guest instance provided by the client on their pipe and bandwidth?  If that's the case, then quite possibly (around the same time as that upgrade) some routing configuration was changed, or firewall changes were made, or whatever box the instance is on had some change made now that it handles your stuff differently.

"Why is the with() construct not included in C#, when it is really cool in VB.NET?","Personally I don't like WITH when it's used after construction - if you need to do several things with an object after it's initialized, usually that behaviour should be encapsulated in the type itself. If you really want to do something like WITH, it's only a matter of declaring a short variable and optionally introducing a new scope. However, it is useful to be able to compactly initialize an object with several properties - which is precisely why C# 3 allows you to write: MyObject x = new MyObject { Name=""Fred"", Age=20, Salary=15000 }; There are limitations to this (which the optional and named parameters in C# 4 will help to overcome) but it's better than it was without leading to potential messes/ambiguities. (On the XML literal front, I'm again with the C# team - XML is a very specific technology to put into a language.

Is switching app.config at runtime possible?,"Are you able to restart the application when you detect that you need to switch files? If so, it's just a matter of switching the files and restarting. Now, the tricky bit is if .NET keeps the app.config file open while the program is running. I suspect it doesn't, but if the most obviously approach fails, I suggest you have a second application (cfgswitcher.exe) which waits for the process with a PID specified on the command line to terminate, then switches config files and relaunches the original process. Then your app would just need to launch cfgswitcher.exe (passing in its own PID as a command line argument) and terminate. As I say though, it's worth trying the more obvious approach first. EDIT: If you can't restart the application (or even part of it in a new AppDomain) then various aspects of app.config (assembly bindings etc) can't be changed. If you're only interested in your own configuration sections changing, then I suggest you store them in a separate config file and reload them whenever you want to. ",c#

If you compare two control groups - one that types in all the code by hand, and another that uses the code generator - I have no doubt at all that the group that uses the code generator will require less time, hands down.  It depends on how far you want to go with the generator, of course, but there's little doubt that as the percentage of generated code goes up that the manual input looks worse and worse. The only concern I have has to do with where that code generator comes from and how much thought went into its design. If you don't want to touch the code that the wizard/code generator produces because you don't understand it, it ought to be counted against the code generator. If the code generator forces you into a bad design, it ought to be counted against the code generator. If the code generator spits out so many classes that nobody can follow what's happening,  it ought to be counted against the code generator. If the code generator makes your maintenance life a hell on earth, it ought to be counted against the code generator. I like the idea of understanding and creating my own tools if I can.

Pre-populate an inline FormSet?,"So, you're not going to like the answer, partly because I'm not yet done writing the code and partly because it's a lot of work. What you need to do, as I discovered when I ran into this myself, is: Spend a lot of time reading through the formset and model-formset code to get a feel for how it all works (not helped by the fact that some of the functionality lives on the formset classes, and some of it lives in factory functions which spit them out). You will need this knowledge in the later steps. Write your own formset class which subclasses from BaseInlineFormSet and accepts initial. The really tricky bit here is that you must override __init__(), and you must make sure that it calls up to BaseFormSet.__init__() rather than using the direct parent or grandparent __init__() (since those are BaseInlineFormSet and BaseModelFormSet, respectively, and neither of them can handle initial data). Write your own subclass of the appropriate admin inline class (in my case it was TabularInline) and override its get_formset method to return the result of inlineformset_factory() using your custom formset class. On the actual ModelAdmin subclass for the model with the inline, override add_view and change_view, and replicate most of the code, but with one big change: build the initial data your formset will need, and pass it to your custom formset (which will be returned by your ModelAdmin's get_formsets() method). I've had a few productive chats with Brian and Joseph about improving this for future Django releases; at the moment, the way the model formsets work just make this more trouble than it's usually worth, but with a bit of API cleanup I think it could be made extremely easy.

It's a little more strict in syntax, with a few very minute differences in terms of things changing. The biggest difference is that C++ makes an attempt at being object oriented.  There's native support for classes. There's a few other perks in C++: templates, stream operators, pass-by-reference (a bit less confusing than pass-by-pointer) What do you lose out for going C++?  It's missing some of the lowest-level hacks that a lot of people use C for.  I don't remember any of them offhand, but I've never heard any good argument for tricking the compiler into doing what you want except as a way to push efficiency that extra 10%. ",c++

Why can't enum's constructor access static fields?,"The constructor is called before the static fields have all been initialized, because the static fields (including those representing the enum values) are initialized in textual order, and the enum values always come before the other fields. Note that in your class example you haven't shown where ABBREV_MAP is initialized - if it's after SUNDAY, you'll get an exception when the class is initialized. Yes, it's a bit of a pain and could probably have been designed better. However, the usual answer in my experience is to have a static {} block at the end of all the static initializers, and do all static initialization there, using EnumSet.allOf  to get at all the values.

Spring.net Drop all adotemplate connections?,"there is no physical ""connection"" between AdoTemplate and the SQL database. Leaving transactions aside, AdoTemplate creates a new SqlConnection object for each method that is executed from ADO.NET, executes a command and disposes the SqlConnection object after that. Under the hoods, ADO.NET caches physical connections to the database in a pool. When you create a new SqlConnection object, 1 of those cached physical connections is obtained from the pool to serve that SqlConnection. This means, that you will need a different strategy for solving your problem. One strategy coming to my mind is to obtain the list of active connections from the sysprocesses database and execute the KILL statement on them. Short googling brought up this article. Note, that this article refers to mssql 2000. I'm pretty sure, that you need to google a bit more to find a solution for 2005.

Why is Long.valueOf(0).equals(Integer.valueOf(0)) false?,"Yes, but it all comes down to the comparing algorithm and how far to take the conversions. For example, what do you want to happen when you try m.Contains(""5"")? Or if you pass it an array with 5 as the first element? Simply speaking, it appears to be wired up ""if the types are different, the keys are different"". Then take a collection with an object as the key. What do you want to happen if you put a 5L, then try to get 5, ""5"", ...? What if you put a 5L and a 5 and a ""5"" and you want to check for a 5F? Since it's a generic collection (or templated, or whatever you wish to call it), it would have to check and do some special comparing for certain value types. If K is int then check if the object passed is long, short, float, double, ..., then convert and compare. If K is float then check if the object passed is ... You get the point. Another implementation could have been to throw an exception if the types didn't match, however, and I often wish it did. ",java

Using Linq for ObjectDataSource: How to transform datetime using ToShortTimeString?,"The reason is the query is being used in LINQ to SQL. LINQ to SQL treats queries as expression trees. It has mappings defined for some methods (for instance, Contains) but since it doesn't really execute them, it can't work on arbitrary methods. It parses the query and submits it to SQL server. The equivalent of the query will be executed as a SQL statement on the database server and the result will come back. The problem is ToShortTimeString() does not have an equivalent SQL translation in LINQ to SQL. The trick used here is to fetch data from SQL server and call the method on the client side (AsEnumerable will do this). return classQuery.Select(p =&gt; new { p.ClassID, p.Title, p.StartDate, p.EndDate })    .AsEnumerable()    .Select(p =&gt; new SelectClassData {         ClassID = p.ClassID,         Title = p.Title,         StartDate = p.StartDate.ToShortDateString(),         EndDate = p.EndDate.ToShortDateString(),         TimeOfClass = p.StartDate.ToShortTimeString() + "" - "" + p.EndDate.ToShortTimeString() })    .ToList(); ",c#

How do I create a list of Python lambdas (in a list comprehension/for loop)?,"I'm guessing that the lambda you're creating in the list comprehension is bound to the variable i which eventually ends up at 5.

When you evaluate the lambda inside the loop it's num hasn't changed so you get the right value. After the loop, num is 5... I'm not quite sure what you're going for, so I'm not sure how to suggest a solution. How about this? def square(x): return lambda : x*x listOfLambdas = [square(i) for i in [1,2,3,4,5]] for f in listOfLambdas: print f() This gives me the expected output: 1 4 9 16 25 Another way to think of this is that a lambda ""captures"" its lexical environment at the point where it is created.

Storing Queries in C# or use Stored Functions in Postgres?,"I quite like storing SQL in text files embedded as resources into the assembly (when I absolutely have to have a significant number of them; I'm an ORM man normally). Quite how you format that text file is up to you, of course. You could have double-line-break delimited: UpdateCustomer: UPDATE CUSTOMER SET NAME=@Name WHERE ID=@ID FindCustomer: SELECT NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMER WHERE ID=@Id etc It's not hard to then have a class which loads that into a Dictionary&lt;string,string&gt; in a type initialier, or even a Dictionary&lt;string,SqlStatementHelper&gt; where the latter is a class to make it easy to prepare the statement with appropriate values. You could use any other format you want though, including XML - although if you didn't need anything else beyond the name/sql pairs, that would probably be overkill. The downside of this is the disconnect between the SQL and the code that uses it - you can't instantly tell what the parameters are without looking at the text file. On the other hand (and I'm just thinking off the cuff here) you probably could autogenerate a class from the SQL (and a bit of metadata) with methods with strongly typed parameters. The mixed blessing of stored procs is that they live in the database rather than in your code. The upside of this is that you're more likely to keep them in sync with DDL changes. The downside is that they're more effort to change (IME, anyway) than queries defined locally. (There are obviously plenty of other pros and cons, but I'm limiting myself to the convenience side here.) As for maintenance - well, I suppose it's possible that you'd have a ""database only"" update of just tables and stored procs, without any clients having to know at all - in which case the stored procs would be a better move. In my experience (certainly with custom solutions where there are only a couple of applications accessing the database, so compatibility isn't as much of an issue) code changes are almost ubiquitous but database changes less so - at which point storing the queries with the application means you're less likely to have to do a database change when you update. Does any of that make sense? I haven't had coffee yet... ",c#

Is there a Perl equivalent of Python's re.findall/re.finditer (iterative regex results)?,"Use the /g modifier in your match. From the perlop manual:   The ""/g"" modifier specifies global pattern matching--that is, matching as many times as possible within the string.  How it behaves depends on the context.  In list context, it returns a list of the substrings matched by any capturing parentheses in the regular expression.  If there are no parentheses, it returns a list of all the matched strings, as if there were parentheses around the whole pattern.      In scalar context, each execution of ""m//g"" finds the next match, returning true if it matches, and false if there is no further match.  The position after the last match can be read or set using the pos() function; see ""pos"" in perlfunc.   A failed match normally resets the search position to the beginning of the string, but you can avoid that by adding the ""/c"" modifier (e.g. ""m//gc"").  Modifying the target string also resets the search position. ",python

Read http://www.eflorenzano.com/blog/post/secrets-django-orm/ http://doughellmann.com/2007/12/30/using-raw-sql-in-django.html, also If you have a proper star schema design in the first place, then one-dimensional results can have the following form. from myapp.models import SomeFact from collections import defaultdict facts = SomeFact.objects.filter( dimension1__attribute=this, dimension2__attribute=that ) myAggregates = defaultdict( int ) for row in facts:     myAggregates[row.dimension3__attribute] += row.someMeasure If you want to create a two-dimensional summary, you have to do something like the following. facts = SomeFact.objects.filter( dimension1__attribute=this, dimension2__attribute=that ) myAggregates = defaultdict( int ) for row in facts:     key = ( row.dimension3__attribute, row.dimension4__attribute )     myAggregates[key] += row.someMeasure To compute multiple SUM's and COUNT's and what-not, you have to do something like this. class MyAgg( object ):     def __init__( self ):         self.count = 0         self.thisSum= 0         self.thatSum= 0 myAggregates= defaultdict( MyAgg ) for row in facts:     myAggregates[row.dimension3__attr].count += 1     myAggregates[row.dimension3__attr].thisSum += row.this     myAggregates[row.dimension3__attr].thatSum += row.that This -- at first blush -- seems inefficient.  You're trolling through the fact table returning lots of rows which you are then aggregating in your application. In some cases, this may be faster than the RDBMS's native sum/group_by.  Why?  You're using a simple mapping, not the more complex sort-based grouping operation that the RDBMS often has to use for this.  Yes, you're getting a lot of rows; but you're doing less to get them.

How to pass an array size as a template with template type?,"Hmm, the Standard says in 14.8.2.4 / 15:   If, in the declaration of a function template with a non-type template-parameter, the non-type template-parameter is used in an expression in the function parameter-list and, if the corresponding template-argument is deduced, the template-argument type shall match the type of the template-parameter exactly, except that a template-argument deduced from an array bound may be of any integral type. Providing this example: template&lt;int i&gt; class A { /* ... */ }; template&lt;short s&gt; void f(A&lt;s&gt;); void k1() {     A&lt;1&gt; a;     f(a);    // error: deduction fails for conversion from int to short     f&lt;1&gt;(a); // OK } That suggests that the compilers that fail to compile your code (apparently GCC and Digital Mars) do it wrong. I tested the code with Comeau, and it compiles your code fine. I don't think there is a different to whether the type of the non-type template parameter depends on the type of the type-parameter or not. 14.8.2.4/2 says the template arguments should be deduced independent from each other, and then combined into the type of the function-parameter. Combined with /15, which allows the type of the dimension to be of different integral type, i think your code is all fine. As always, i take the c++-is-complicated-so-i-may-be-wrong card :)  Update: I've looked into the passage in GCC where it spits out that error message:   ...   type = TREE_TYPE (size);   /* The array bound must be an integer type.  */   if (!dependent_type_p (type) &amp;&amp; !INTEGRAL_TYPE_P (type))     {       if (name)     error (""size of array %qD has non-integral type %qT"", name, type);       else     error (""size of array has non-integral type %qT"", type);       size = integer_one_node;       type = TREE_TYPE (size);     }   ...

"In Java, how can I construct a ""proxy wrapper"" around an object which invokes a method upon changing a property?","The design pattern you are looking for is: Differential Execution.  I do believe. How does differential execution work? Is a question I answered that deals with this.  However, may I suggest that you use a callback instead?  You will have to read about this, but the general idea is that you can implement interfaces (often called listeners) that active upon ""something interesting"" happening.  Such as having a data structure be changed. Obligitory links: Wiki Differential execution Wiki Callback Alright, here is the answer as I see it.  Differential Execution is O(N) time.  This is really reasonable, but if that doesn't work for ya Callbacks will.  Callbacks basically work by passing a method by parameter to your class that is changing the array.  This method will take the value changed and the location of the item, pass it back by parameter to the ""storage class"" and change the value approipriately.  So, yes, you have to back each change with a method call.   I realize now this is not what you want.  What it appears that you want is a way that you can supply some kind of listener on each variable in an array that would be called when that item is changed.  The listener would then change the corresponding array in your ""backup"" to refect this change.   Natively I can't think of a way to do this.  You can, of course, create your own listeners and events, using an interface.  This is basically the same idea as the callbacks, though nicer to look at. Then there is reflection... Java has reflection, and I am positive you can write something using it to do this.  However, reflection is notoriously slow.  Not to mention a pain to code (in my opinion).    Hope that helps...

For example, launching a thread in ACE requires creating a new class derived from ACE_Task, and overriding the virtual svc() function which is called when your thread runs.

Is BCrypt a good hashing algorithm to use in C#? Where can I find it?,"First, some terms that are important: Hashing - The act of taking a string and producing a sequence of characters that cannot be reverted to the original string. Symmetric Encryption - (Usually just referred to as 'encryption') - The act of taking a string and producing a sequence of characters that can  be decrypted to the original string through the use of the same encryption key that encrypted it. Rainbow Table - a lookup table that contains all variations of characters hashed in a specific hashing algorithm. Salt - a known random string appended to the original string before it is hashed. For the .NET Framework, Bcrypt does not yet have a verified reference implementation. This is important because there's no way to know if there are serious flaws in an existing implementation. You can get an implementation of BCrypt for .NET here. I don't know enough about cryptography to say whether it's a good or bad implementation. Cryptography is a very deep field.  Do not attempt to build your own encryption algorithm. Seriously.  If you are going to implement your own password security (sigh), then you need to do several things:  Use a relatively secure hash algorithm. Salt each password before it's hashed. Use a unique and long salt for each password, and store the salt with the password. Require strong passwords. Unfortunately, even if you do all this, a determined hacker still could potentially figure out the passwords, it would just take him a really long time. That's your chief enemy: Time. The bcrypt algorithm works because it takes five orders of magnitude longer to hash a password than MD5; (and still much longer than AES or SHA-512).  It forces the hacker to spend a lot more time to create a rainbow table to lookup your passwords, making it far less likely that your passwords will be in jeopardy of being hacked. If you're salting and hashing your passwords, and each salt is different, then a potential hacker would have to create a rainbow table for each variation of salt, just to have a rainbow table for one salted+hashed password.  That means if you have 1 million users, a hacker has to generate 1 million rainbow tables.  If you're using the same salt for every user, then the hacker only has to generate 1 rainbow table to successfully hack your system. If you're not salting your passwords, then all an attacker has to do is to pull up an existing Rainbow table for every implementation out there (AES, SHA-512, MD5) and just see if one matches the hash.  This has already been done, an attacker does not need to calculate these Rainbow tables themselves. Even with all this, you've got to be using good security practices.  If they can successfully use another attack vector (XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, et. al.) on your site, good password security doesn't matter.  That sounds like a controversial statement, but think about it: If I can get all your user information through a SQL injection attack, or I can get your users to give me their cookies through XSS, then it doesn't matter how good your password security is. Other resources: Jeff Atwood: .NET Encryption Simplified (great for an overview of hashing) Jeff Atwood: I just logged in as you Jeff Atwood: You're probably storing passwords incorrectly Jeff Atwood: Speed Hashing Note: Please recommend other good resources. I've must have read a dozen articles by dozens of authors, but few write as plainly on the subject as Jeff does.  Please edit in articles as you find them. ",c#
is there some dojo.fx.sleep function to use within a dojo.fx.chain animation?,"Positive there isn't at this point in time; the only way to achieve the effect is to split your code into pre-sleep and post-sleep sections, which you've pretty much done here.

"What's the right way, for testability, to add functionality to a ComboBox?","As with the post you references: seperating the logic from the gui elements is also the solution here. You should consider using a controller-like class which exposes a list of items which you can databind to your ComboBox' DataSource. The controller itself is responsible for maintaining this list. So whenever you type a letter in the ComboBox you call a function on the controller, let's say UpdateList(string typedString). In this way you have seperated the logic of filling the list with 'candidates'. Now you can easily write a number of tests which each call UpdateList() with different arguments and inspect the list of items afterwards. No GUI stuff needed to do the testing, you're only testing the algorithm itself. ",c#

How different is CakePHP from Ruby on Rails?,"CakePHP is like a cheap, bastardized ripoff of Rails. It tries to be like Rails without doing any of the stuff that makes Rails great. It kinda feels similar, I guess. CakePHP has an Ajax helper that does something similar to the Ajax-related helper methods in Rails, so yes, in some way, it's also true. But CakePHP is really an exercise in futility: its authors wrote it so they wouldn't have to learn Ruby, even though learning Ruby and Rails together is probably easier than figuring out the monstrous mess that is CakePHP. (This, coming from somebody who does CakePHP at his day job.) Since y'all asked, my biggest complaint about CakePHP is how it manages to totally butcher the conveniences of object-oriented programming: sure, it implements the Active Record pattern just as much as Rails does, but it makes you pass around data structures. I feel like any logical person would implement an ORM using faulting and dynamic loading of properties in to objects, which is exactly what ActiveRecord (the Rails library) does. The whole idea of setting a member variable called $recursive to determine which relationships to load is just plain flawed. Being based on PHP is pretty fatal, too; you can't do anything with global state, you have to depend on mod_rewrite, you pay the startup penalty on every request. Sure, there's optimizations for any environment you're using, but still. People say Ruby is slow, but my own Rails apps run faster than their CakePHP equivalents, last I checked. I admit to being without data on this. Worst of all, the bugs in CakePHP just about kill it for me. I could tell any number of stories about the time we spent two days figuring out why CakePHP refused to connect to the right database host the time half of our pages went blank because of the memory ceiling from using too many components the amount of code that lives in our AppController because every component load costs several megabytes of memory the black art of massaging data structures to make XML output work correctly how we traced down the blank &lt;javascript&gt; tag that shows up at the end of every page ",php

The servlet map pings it generates must go into your webappâs WEB-INF/web.xml file, but it would be difficult to write an Ant build file that knows how to insert the servlet mappings into your web.xml  file in a repeatable way every time the build file runs. Instead, we used an XML entity include so that the generated servlet mappings go into a new file every time the build file runs and that servlet mappings file can be inserted into your web.xml file via the XML entity include mechanism. To use it, your webappâs WEB- INF/web.xml must have a special entity declaration at the top of the file, plus a reference to the entity in the content of the web.xml  file where you want the servlet mappings file to be included. Here is how an empty servlet 2.5 webappâs web.xml  file looks with these modifications: &lt;!DOCTYPE jspc-webxml [     &lt;!ENTITY jspc-webxml SYSTEM ""jspc-web.xml""&gt;   ]&gt;    &lt;web-app xmlns=http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee       xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/ XMLSchema-instance        xsi:schemaLocation=""http:// java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/    javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd""       version=""2.5""&gt;      &lt;!-- We include the JspC-generated mappings here. --&gt;     &amp;jspc-webxml;      &lt;!-- Non-generated web.xml content goes here. --&gt;    &lt;/web-app&gt; Make sure your webappâs web.xml file has the inline DTD (the DOCTYPE tag) all the way at the top of the file and the servlet 2.5 web-app schema declaration below that. Then, wherever you want to insert the generated servlet mappings in your web.xml   file, put the entity reference &amp;jspc-webxml; . Remember, the entity reference begins with an ampersand ( &amp; ), then has the name of the entity, and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).  To use the build file, just edit it and set all of the properties at the top to values that match your setup, and then run it like this:  $ ant -f pre-compile-jsps.xml   ",java
Is Django a good choice for a security critical application?,"Probably the reason behind Java is not in the in the security.

Javascript DOM - add form element to newly created appendChild?,"I'm assuming that you are trying to avoid having the remove button in the first row, but need it there now because you think that to get it in subsequent rows, you need to have it in the row that you are cloning.  If, instead, you just insert new HTML for both the upload and delete button inputs in the addRow method you can avoid the clone entirely and it won't matter what your original row contains. function addRow(table_id){    var table = document.getElementById(table_id);    var row = table.insertRow(table.rows.length);    var cell = row.insertCell(0);    var template = table.rows[0].cells[0].innerHTML;    cell.innerHTML = template + '&lt;input type=""button"" value=""Remove Row""'                  + ' onclick=""delRow(\'' + table_id + '\',this);"" /&gt;' } This still uses the first row as the template, but you can remove the button from it as it is added by appending to the existing text.

"On Linux, is the command-line program mktemp less safe than the C-function mkstemp?","The most obvious difference between a system call and a command line function is that command line functions are used by people or their shell scripts, while system calls are always done by programs.  It would be quite hard to hand a person a file handle.  Regarding ""safety"", you should think about race conditions: several instances of one program call mkstemp at the same time, but each one is guaranteed to have a unique temporary file. If the program shelled out and called the command line version, it'd be almost impossible to guarantee this. ",c++

How do Django model fields work?,"Yes, first_name and last_name are class variables. They define fields that will be created in a database table.

For more on models, see: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/ When it comes to accessing instances of a Person in code, you are typically doing this via Django's ORM, and at this point they essentially behave as instance variables.

How to efficiently implement an event loop?,"With event objects. The main thread calls CreateEvent() in its initialisation to create an auto-reset event object. The main thread then enters an event loop in which it calls MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() repeatedly.  (here is an example of a message loop.) And you generally do need to check for window messages, even if the main thread has no GUI. In the client thread (the one that creates the sink object) call SetEvent() within the sink method, after any necessary state update.  This will wake up the main thread.

How would you build a HttpTraceListener?,"Because of your requirements about variable logging, i.e. not issuing a request for every entry, you will most certainly need to create your own listener. Per MSDN docs on TraceListener (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracelistener(VS.80).aspx) ""Inherit from this class to implement a custom listener for the Debug and Trace classes. At a minimum, you must implement the Write and WriteLine methods. Additionally, you can implement the Fail, Close and Flush methods."" I would start with: Inherit from TraceListener. Implement the Write/WriteLine methods Add your logic in Write to submit the request to a web service.  WriteLine simply appends a line terminator, if you use the base class implementation. Override Fail/Close/Flush as needed for your application. Those 5 methods will give you all the access you need to implement your listener. ",c#
How do I get a list of available NamedCache objects from ScaleOut StateServer (SOSS)?,"Apparently, there is no way to do this in v4.0 - the keys for both the stores themselves, as well as the keys for the values are stored as hashes (in the form of uints), so unless the NamedCache is retrieved using the actual name, the name cannot be known.

What's the best way to read mixed (i.e. text and binary) data?,"Is this file format already fixed? If it's not, it's a really good idea to change to use a length-prefixed format for the strings. Then you can read just the right amount and convert it to a string. Otherwise, you'll need to read chunks from the file, scan for the newline, and decode the right amount of data or (if you don't find the newline) either buffer it somewhere else (e.g. a MemoryStream) or just remember the starting point and rewind the stream appropriately. It will be ugly, but that's just because of the deficiency of the file format. I would suggest you don't ""over-decode"" (i.e. decode the arbitrary binary data after the string) - while it may well not do any harm, in some encodings you could be reading an impossible sequence of binary data, which then starts getting into the realms of DecoderFallbacks and the like.

Can I ignore delegate parameters with lambda syntax?,"The () => ... syntax explicitly specifies that the lambda takes no parameters.  Perhaps the language could be modified so that () => really meant ""Infer the parameters of this lambda for me"" in the same way the delegate syntax does, but that would make the language more complicated.  When designing new language features, you start at minus 100, and I don't think this one passes the test.

What is the shortest way to implement a proxy or decorator class in c#?,"Unfortunately, there is no mixin support in C#.

"How to bind nested objects, or master-detail-binding, in code?","Edit: adding a bit more details. Ok, so let's say you have a Show object. This has a collection of Seasons. Each Season has a collection of Episodes. You can then have the DataContext for the entire control be the Show object. Bind your TextBlock to the show's Name. Text=""{Binding Name""} Bind the ItemsSource of the seasons list box to the Seasons collection. ItemsSource=""{Binding Seasons}"" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem=""True"" Bind the ItemsSource of the episodes list box to the current Season's Episodes collection. ItemsSource=""{Binding Seasons/Episodes}"".

Also, to translate this into code is pretty easy and you were on the right path. The main issue with your code was that you were naming the list boxes, when they don't really need it.

What are valid characters for a DNS Zone file and how can I sanitize user input?,"Domain name labels can technically contain any octet value, but usually they only contain alphanumerics and the hyphen and underscore characters.  This comes from recommendations in section 2.3.1 of RFC 1035:   The labels must follow the rules for   ARPANET host names.  They must start   with a letter, end with a letter or   digit, and have as interior characters   only letters, digits, and hyphen.    There are also some restrictions on   the length.  Labels must be 63   characters or less. The underscore character is a more recent addition, typically used in the label portion of SRV records. You could also permit the ""."" character if you're going to let users create their own subdomains. The values that are possible are: A record - must be a dotted-quad IP address CNAME record - must be some other legal label MX record - 16-bit integer priority field, and a legal hostname.  NB: some people put in labels which themselves point only to a CNAME record.  This is frowned upon. TXT record - anything you like!

How do I get a reference to the underlying object in a bound DataGridViewComboBoxCell?,"You could use an IList of KeyValuePairs of ""Name"" and your custom object.

Network Programming: to maintain sockets or not?,"It depends on how frequent you expect the user to type in commands. If it happens quite infrequently, you could perhaps close the sockets. If frequent, creating sockets repeatedly can be an expensive operation. Now having said that, how expensive, in terms of machine resources, is it to have a socket connection open for infrequent data? Why exactly do you think that ""maintaining a Socket and output stream for outbound comms is not such a good idea"" (even though it seems the right thing to do)? On the other hand, this is different for file streams if you expect that other processes might want to use the same file. Closing the file stream quickly in this case would be the way to go. How likely is it that you are going to run out of the many TCP connections you can create, which other processes making outbound connections might want to use?

How can I determine property types using reflection?,"What type are you interested in? The return type of the method/property/event etc? If so, I don't think there's anything in MemberInfo to let you get at it directly - you'll need to cast and use MethodInfo.ReturnType, PropertyInfo.PropertyType, FieldInfo.FieldType, EventInfo.EventHandlerType and any others I've forgotten. (Remember that types themselves can be members. Not sure what you'll want to do with them!) EDIT: If you're interested in whether a specific Type represents either MyType or some subclass, then use Type.IsAssignableFrom: if (typeof(MyType).IsAssignableFrom(type)) EDIT: Now that we know you want properties, it's easy - use GetProperties instead of GetMembers. I like doing reflection with LINQ: var query = from type in assembly.GetTypes()             from property in type.GetProperties()             where typeof(MyType).IsAssignableFrom(property.PropertyType)             select new { Type=type, Property=property }; foreach (var entry in query) {     Console.WriteLine(entry); } If you're not a fan of LINQ: foreach (Type t in a.GetTypes())     foreach (PropertyInfo pi in t.GetProperties())         if (typeof(MyType).IsAssignableFrom(pi.PropertyType))             Console.WriteLine(""Found a property that is MyType""); Note that you might want to specify binding flags to get non-public properties etc. ",c#

Is there a good way to call a CGI script from a PHP script?,"Use exec() if you can call it locally.

You can pass parameters through include(), file_get_contents(), and virtual() as GET parameters:  http://localhost/cgi-bin/foo?param1=val1&amp;param2=val2 If possible, go the exec() route. Using the other methods may require a config change. When using exec(), you'll need to pass the arguments like you would for any CLI program. foo val1 val2 foo param1=val1 param2=val2 How you pass the parameters in will depend on how you want to parse them out later in the other program/script.

How can I strip Python logging calls without commenting them out?,"As an imperfect shortcut, how about mocking out logging in specific modules using something like MiniMock? For example, if my_module.py was: import logging class C(object):     def __init__(self, *args, **kw):         logging.info(""Instantiating"") You would replace your use of my_module with: from minimock import Mock import my_module my_module.logging = Mock('logging') c = my_module.C() You'd only have to do this once, before the initial import of the module. Getting the level specific behaviour would be simple enough by mocking specific methods, or having logging.getLogger return a mock object with some methods impotent and others  delegating to the real logging module. In practice, you'd probably want to replace MiniMock with something simpler and faster; at the very least something which doesn't print usage to stdout! Of course, this doesn't handle the problem of module A importing logging from module B (and hence A also importing the log granularity of B)... This will never be as fast as not running the log statements at all, but should be much faster than going all the way into the depths of the logging module only to discover this record shouldn't be logged after all.

Sockets in C#: How to get the response stream?,"Socket, by definition, is the low level to access the network. You can even use datagram protocols with a socket.

"C# ComboBox in DropDownList style, how do I set the text?","The code you specify: comboBox.Text = ""Wildcards""; ...should work. The only reason it would not is that the text you specify is not an item within the comboBox's item list. When using the DropDownList style, you can only set Text to values that actually appear in the list. If it is the case that you are trying to set the text to Wildcards and that item does not appear in the list, and an alternative solution is not acceptable, you may have to be a bit dirty with the code and add an item temporarily that is removed when the drop-down list is expanded. For example, if you have a form containing a combobox named ""comboBox1"" with some items and a button named ""button1"" you could do something like this: private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     if (!comboBox1.Items.Contains(""Wildcards""))     {         comboBox1.Items.Add(""Wildcards"");     }     comboBox1.Text = ""Wildcards""; } private void comboBox1_DropDown(object sender, EventArgs e) {     if (comboBox1.Items.Contains(""Wildcards""))         comboBox1.Items.Remove(""Wildcards""); } That's pretty quick and dirty but by capturing the DropDownClosed event too you could clean it up a bit, adding the ""Wildcards"" item back as needed.

which design pattern to use for filtering query? c#,"The strategy pattern doesn't necessarily knit well with the common interface-based repository approach.

With LINQ, maybe a predicate expression? IList&lt;Product&gt; GetProducts(Expression&lt;Func&lt;Product,bool&gt;&gt; predicate); Of course, with LINQ you could also use composition by the caller, but that is harder to write a closed / fully-tested repository for:  `IQueryable&lt;Product&gt; Products {get;}` (and have the caller use .Where(x=>x.Category == ""foo"")) - I'm not so sure about this last one long-term...

What is a good desktop programming language to learn for a web developer?,"Take a brief look at C first, to the level of writing a few tutorial programs.

One of the pleasures of writing C is it's not too hard to reach the level where one can just code without having to continually refer to documentation to see how to use little know feature x or library function y.  Think of learning C as putting the foundations in. However to actually write useful applications you'll want to use C++ or C#.  Which depends on what you wish to write.

Afterthought edit: Another reason for at least familiarising yourself with C first is that there's also Objective-C as the main development environment on the Mac and iPhone.  Objective-C is C with a very thin wrapper and only really a first cousin to C++, so if you envisage that you might ever be in the position where you want to port code to or develop directly on the Mac then I think you'd find it less confusing if you at least have some feel for how C++ (or C#) builds on C rather than having to 'step sideways' across the tree.

Objective-C is C with a very thin wrapper and only really a first cousin to C++, so if you envisage that you might ever be in the position where you want to port code to or develop directly on the Mac then I think you'd find it less confusing if you at least have some feel for how C++ (or C#) builds on C rather than having to 'step sideways' across the tree.

Do Strongly Typed Datasets improve performance?,"I'm not sure if there will be any performance improvements using the strongly typed datasets, however you get the added type safety, and with it compiler errors when you mistype a field name, for example.

Zend Form: How do I make it bend to my will?,"Currently we've got the new and shiny Zend\Form which is even more complex than the old component but also much more controllable, encapsulated and powerfull. So, what I said below doesn't apply. The new component is IMHO a huge improvement because it... ...gives you full control over how you want to render your form, you need to write a bit more view code but it's worth it ...separates data, logics and view to the maximally possible extent ...makes use of the HTML5 form elements ...gives you many options how you want to put your forms together, e.g. hydration, annotations, etc. Old answer regarding Zend_Form I can not really help probably because I have exactly the same problem. I think the Zend_Form decorators are powerful but by far the least programmer friendly and non-intuitive piece of ZF I've seen so far and I've used a major part of the ZF in various projects. That said I can only give a few hints from my experience: filters are easy to use without using form most if not all of the things you want to achieve are done with the help of decorators I started with small forms and added stuff piece by piece but I don't get some of the stuff I'm doing in some of my forms because the result is based on trial and error (mainly with the decorators) I've got information from the zend mailinglist which I couldn't have found anywhere on the web From the related questions to this on the right hand side it is obvious that there is a lack of comprehensive documentation for Zend_Form especially given it's non-intuitive nature. I would really like to see the ZF guys do something about this as much as I like Zend Framework.  So this answer is probably just to let you know that you're not the only one having the this problem. or alternatively you could use jedi mind tricks of course! ",php
Is there a .NET Culture-dependent 'Today' string?,"This is a pretty comprehensive overview of .Net localization. In a nutshell, methods of the DateTime structure will format the date based on the system locale. You can override the default locale by specifying your own. Edit: Sorry, I misread your question. No, there is no such thing. You could use a translation site to get the translations of 'Today' that you need to support, and keep them in a dictionary in your code.  Upon closer examination, though, I would not recommend this at all, since the resulting string ""Today: xx/xx/xxx"" may feel awkward in other languages. While the German version: ""Heute: 11.2.2009"", or the French ""Aujourd'hui: 11.2.2009"" seem to work ok in a calendar, I can't say for Chinese or Japanese. This illustrates the issues that you can run into when you think localization is just translation. ",c#
How does Excel VSTO Work?,"This is all done in the Registry, you should be able to find the key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Excel or your equivelant application. I've more experience with COM Addins which are registered somewhere else in the Registry as well. This key should have a LoadBehaviour item under it which is used to determine how the application is loaded (2 is load manually, 3 is load automatically on startup). Do you have a Setup Project for your VSTO? Inside there you can see the Registry key that is set, but the Setup program will/should also Register the VSTO in GAC (though don't take my word for it as I'm a bit shakey with VSTO as I said). Hope this helps, I shall try and find some more information for you. Edit You should try reading the following http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386298.aspx which will give you an explanation of what the addin is. It's really just a wrapper around a COM host which is loaded from the Registry and the VSTO talks to that using some Interoparability code. Also useful are http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/23cw517s.aspx (Getting Started with Visual Studio Tools for Office, don't knock it because it says Getting Started in, there's a lot of useful info in there) and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hy7c6z9k.aspx (Which is linked from the first and is an overview of VSTO Addins).

Execute arbitrary python code remotely - can it be done?,"It sounds like you want to do the following. Define a shared filesystem space. Put ALL your python source in this shared filesystem space. Define simple agents or servers that will ""execfile"" a block of code. Your client then contacts the agent (REST protocol with POST methods works well for this) with the block of code. The agent saves the block of code and does an execfile on that block of code. Since all agents share a common filesystem, they all have the same Python library structure. We do with with a simple WSGI application we call ""batch server"".  We have RESTful protocol for creating and checking on remote requests. ",python
How to connect to a secure website using SSL in Java with a pkcs12 file?,"It appears that you are extracting you certificate from the PKCS #12 key store and creating a new Java key store (with type ""JKS""). You don't strictly have to provide a trust store password (although using one allows you to test the integrity of your root certificates). So, try your program with only the following SSL properties set. The list shown in your question is over-specified and may be causing problems. System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""myTrustStore""); System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""changeit""); Also, using the PKCS #12 file directly as the trust store should work, as long as the CA certificate is detected as a ""trusted"" entry. But in that case, you'll have to specify the javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType property as ""PKCS12"" too. Try with these properties only. If you get the same error, I suspect your problem is not the key store. If it still occurs, post more of the stack trace in your question to narrow the problem down. The new error, ""the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty,"" could be due to setting the javax.net.ssl.trustStore property to a file that doesn't exist; if the file cannot be opened, an empty key store created, which would lead to this error.

Additionally, the better safe-delete is not necessary, as you could use smart-pointers, therefore not requiring to remember using this method in the client-code, but encapsulating it.

How can I insert an image into a RichTextBox?,"The most straightforward way would be to modify the RTF code to insert the picture yourself.  In RTF, a picture is defined like this: '{' \pict (brdr? &amp; shading? &amp; picttype &amp; pictsize &amp; metafileinfo?) data '}'  A question mark indicates the control word is optional. ""data"" is simply the content of the file in hex format. If you want to use binary, use the \bin control word.  For instance: {\pict\pngblip\picw10449\pich3280\picwgoal5924\pichgoal1860 hex data} {\pict\pngblip\picw10449\pich3280\picwgoal5924\pichgoal1860\bin binary data} \pict = starts a picture group,  \pngblip = png picture \picwX =  width of the picture (X is the pixel value) \pichX = height of the picture \picwgoalX = desired width of the picture in twips So, to insert a picture, you just need to open your picture, convert the data to hex, load these data into a string and add the RTF codes around it to define a RTF picture. Now, you have a self contained string with picture data which you can insert in the RTF code of a document. Don't forget the closing ""}"" Next, you get the RTF code from your RichTextBox (rtbBox.Rtf), insert the picture at the proper location, and set the code of rtbBox.Rtf One issue you may run into is that .NET RTB does not have a very good support of the RTF standard.  I have just made a small application* which allows you to quickly test some RTF code inside a RTB and see how it handles it. You can download it here:  RTB tester (http://your-translations.com/toys).  You can paste some RTF content (from Word, for instance) into the left RTF box and click on the ""Show RTF codes"" to display the RTF codes in the right RTF box, or you can paste RTF code in the right RTB and click on ""Apply RTF codes"" to see the results on the left hand side.  You can of course edit the codes as you like, which makes it quite convenient for testing whether or not the RichTextBox supports the commands you need, or learn how to use the RTF control words.   You can download a full specification for RTF online. NB It's just a little thing I slapped together in 5 minutes, so I didn't implement file open or save, drag and drop, or other civilized stuff.

How do I build an object that stores pictures?,"One of the major things I would consider is whether the photo actually needs to be stored in the object, or whether you just need a link to a file, URL or database. Photos tend to use a lot of memory, so keeping it out of memory until you actually need to display it is probably good design. Apart from that, I'd consider some sort of arbitrary tagging mechanism, and look at the tagging mechanisms that already exist in JPEG. You might want to look at EXIF, one of the tagging standards to get some ideas for properties. However, new ones are invented al the time, so rather than having a property for each possibility, a more general Map based structure might be better for your object. ",java

How do I secure my JsonResult GET calls?,"You can do something similar as the anti XSRF methods. Just generate some ID insert it into the javascript and when the user calls your JSON url, have that url include the generated ID and check if it is there. A defense against XSRF is also using the sessionID as key, this doesn't stop the user executing it from another website for his own account though.  Some hash based on the session and time might do the trick. Ofcourse if the user copies the value from the JS, he can still execute it from another location, but you can have that value expire every x minutes. Another option is to set a cookie with JS and read it serverside. Hope this gives you some ideas to get you started. ",jquery

Templates: Use forward declarations to reduce compile time?,"You can't forward declare ""parts"" of classes like that. Even if you could, you'd still need to instantiate the code somewhere so you could link against it. There are ways to handle it, you could make yourself a little library with instantiations of common containers (e.g. vector) and link them in. Then you'd only ever need to compile e.g. vector&lt;int&gt; once. To implement this you'll need to use something like -fno-implicit-templates, at least assuming you are sticking with g++ and explicitly instantiate the template in your lib with template class std::vector&lt;int&gt; So, a real working example. Here I have 2 files, a.cpp and b.cpp a.cpp: #include &lt;vector&gt; // still need to know the interface #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; int main(int argc, char **argv) {   std::vector&lt;int&gt;* vec = new std::vector&lt;int&gt;();   vec-&gt;push_back(3);   delete vec;   return EXIT_SUCCESS; } So now I can compile a.cpp with -fno-implicit-templates: g++ -fno-implicit-templates -c a.cpp This will give me a.o. If I then I try to link a.o I get: g++ a.o /usr/bin/ld: Undefined symbols: std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt;::_M_insert_aux(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, int const&amp;) void std::_Destroy&lt;int*, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt;(int*, int*, std::allocator&lt;int&gt;) collect2: ld returned 1 exit status No good. So we turn to b.cpp: #include &lt;vector&gt; template class std::vector&lt;int&gt;; template void std::_Destroy(int*,int*, std::allocator&lt;int&gt;); template void std::__uninitialized_fill_n_a(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, unsigned long, int const&amp;, std::allocator&lt;int&gt;); template void std::__uninitialized_fill_n_a(int*, unsigned long, int const&amp;, std::allocator&lt;int&gt;); template void std::fill(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, int const&amp;); template __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt; std::fill_n(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, unsigned long, int const&amp;); template int* std::fill_n(int*, unsigned long, int const&amp;); template void std::_Destroy(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;, std::allocator&lt;int&gt;); Now you're saying to yourself, where did all these extra template things come from? I see the template class std::vector&lt;int&gt; and that's fine, but what about the rest of it? Well the short answer is that, these things implementations are by necessity a little messy, and when you manually instantiate them, by extension some of this messiness leaks out. You're probably wondering how I even figured out what I needed to instantiate. Well I used the linker errors ;). So now we compile b.cpp g++ -fno-implicit-templates -c b.cpp And we get b.o. Linking a.o and b.o we can get g++ a.o b.o Hooray, no linker errors. So, to get into some details about your updated question, if this is a home brewed class it doesn't necessarily have to be this messy. For instance, you can separate the interface from the implementation, e.g. say we have c.h, c.cpp, in addition to a.cpp and b.cpp c.h template&lt;typename T&gt; class MyExample {   T m_t;   MyExample(const T&amp; t);   T get();   void set(const T&amp; t); }; c.cpp template&lt;typename T&gt; MyExample&lt;T&gt;::MyExample(const T&amp; t) : m_t(t) {} template&lt;typename T&gt; T MyExample&lt;T&gt;::get() { return m_t; } template&lt;typename T&gt; void MyExample&lt;T&gt;::set(const T&amp; t) { m_t = t; } a.cpp  #include ""c.h"" // only need interface  #include &lt;iostream&gt;  int main() {    MyExample&lt;int&gt; x(10);    std::cout &lt;&lt; x.get() &lt;&lt; std::endl;    x.set( 9 );    std::cout &lt;&lt; x.get() &lt;&lt; std::endl;    return EXIT_SUCCESS;  } b.cpp, the ""library"":  #include ""c.h"" // need interface  #include ""c.cpp"" // need implementation to actually instantiate it  template class MyExample&lt;int&gt;; Now you compile b.cpp to b.o once. When a.cpp changes you just need to recompile that and link in b.o. ",c++

Is it a good idea to store serialized objects in a Database instead of multiple xml text files?,"The answer for this really depends on the details. What kind of data are storing? How do you need to query it? How often will you need to query it? Generally, I would say it's not a good idea to do both 1 and 2. The problem with option 2 is that you it will be much harder to query for specific fields. If you're going to do a LIKE query and have it search a really long string, it's going to be an expensive operation and you'll likely run into perf issues later on. If you really want to stay away from having to write code to read multiple columns to load your data, look into using an ORM like Linq to SQL. That will help load database tables into objects for you. ",c#

The ""form or service"" code goes something like this: static class Program { 	/// &lt;summary&gt; 	/// The main entry point for the application. 	/// &lt;/summary&gt; 	private static void Main(string[] args) 	{ 		if (args.Length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; args[0] == ""/form"") 		{ 			var form = new MainForm(); 			Application.Run(form); 			return; 		} 		var ServicesToRun = new ServiceBase[] 	        { 		        new BackgroundService() 	        }; 		ServiceBase.Run(ServicesToRun); 	} } ",c#

Possible memory leak?,"It seems scary that you: Mix dynamic memory with static string constants (""No errors."") in the same pointer. Use an explicit while-loop to compute the string's length; have you not heard of strlen()? Use such low-level C-like string processing, for no good reason ... What's wrong with std::string? Don't properly account for the terminating '\0' in the string, when allocating space for it and copying it. The length is also not stored, leaving the resulting char array rather difficult to interpret. ",c++
Why is memory still accessible after std::map::clear() is called?,"If you store pointers on a map (or a list, or anything like that) YOU are the responsible for deleting the pointers, since the map doesn't know if they have been created with new, or not. The clear function only invokes destructors if you don't use pointers. Oh, and one more thing: invoking a destructor (or even calling delete) doesn't mean the memory can't be accessed anymore. It only means that you will be accessing garbage if you do. ",c++
How to keep track of thread progress in Python without freezing the PyQt GUI?,"You are always going to have this problem in Python.  Google GIL ""global interpretor lock"" for more background.  There are two generally recommended ways to get around the problem that you are experiencing: use Twisted, or use a module similar to the multiprocessing module introduced in 2.5. Twisted will require that you learn asynchronous programming techniques which may be confusing in the beginning but will be helpful if you ever need to write high throughput network apps and will be more beneficial to you in the long run. The multiprocessing module will fork a new process and uses IPC to make it behave as if you had true threading.  Only downside is that you would need python 2.5 installed which is fairly new and inst' included in most Linux distros or OSX by default. ",python

Why is Java EE scalable?,"Java EE is considered scalable because if you consider the EJB architecture and run on an appropriate application server, it includes facilities to transparently cluster and allow the use of multiple instances of the EJB to serve requests.  If you managed things manually in plain-old-java, you would have to figure out all of this yourself, for example by opening ports, synchronizing states, etc. I am not sure you could define Google as a ""large website"". That would be like likening the internet to your office LAN. Java EE was not meant to scale to the global level, which is why sites like Amazon and Google use their own technologies (e.g., with use of MapReduce). There are many papers discussing the efficiency of Java EE scalability. For example this ",java

How can I unobtrusively disable submit buttons with Javascript and Prototype?,"You need to do exactly what the answer says : ""Do not disable the button in its ""onclick"", but save it, and do it in form's onsubmit.""

Then add another event handler in your online - to the form, not the submit buttons - that does the disabling.  function reallyGreySubmits(e) {      // This causes IE to not submit at all      $$(""input[type='submit']"").each(function(v) {v.disabled = true;})  }  Event.observe(window, 'load', function() {      $$(""input[type='submit']"").each(function(e) {         Event.observe(e, 'click', greySubmits);      });      $$(""form"").each(function(e) {         Event.observe(e, 'submit', reallyGreySubmits);      });   }); Another option, which I've used is to not disable the submits but to swap visibility between two elements.

Implement map in javascript that supports object methods as mapped functions?,"   Trying to call map( Menu.add , languages ) Here your problem is almost certainly that of JavaScript's lack of bound methods. The setting of âthisâ for a function is determined only at call-time, by examining how the method was obtained.

But if you say: obj2.method= obj.method; obj2.method(); Now âthisâ inside the function will be obj2, not obj! Similarly, if you pick the method off its object and refer to it as a first-class object: var method= obj.method; method(); There will be no object for âthisâ to get set to, so JavaScript sets it to the global object (aka âwindowâ for web browsers). This is probably what is happening in your case: the âMenu.addâ method loses all reference to its owner âMenuâ, so when it gets called back it is most likely unknowingly writing to members of the âwindowâ object instead of a menu. This is of course highly unusual for an OO language, and almost never what you want, but hey, that's how JavaScript rolls. Causing silent, hard-to-debug errors is all part of the language's rationale.

Good ASP.NET excel-like Grid control?,"It does not exist today. There are products such as those you have mentioned which have tried, but in my experience none of them will make an experienced Excel user happy. My company makes Excel compatible spreadsheet components for use with Windows Forms and ASP.NET. We have been getting this question for years, so we have of course considered building one because it looks like a good business. But HTML / JavaScript is just not a suitable platform for building something which ""feels right"" to users who want it to work like Excel - IMO. We have settled on the idea of building a spreadsheet control for Silverlight. I believe this will give you the best of both worlds - cross platform rich interactive spreadsheet in the browser which any Excel user would be comfortable with. Unfortunately, that is not going to happen this month or next... At my previous company, we actually built a spreadsheet component as a Netscape Plugin, as an ActiveX control and as a Java Applet. They had a little bit of success, but none of these technologies ever became ubiquitous in the enterprise for various reasons. I believe Microsoft is finally getting it right with Silverlight and that Silverlight will become the gold standard for browser based Line of Business applications in the Enterprise. EDIT: I should have mentioned that the product I alluded to above is Formula One / NET (Netscape Plugin released ~1995), Formula One / ActiveX and Formula One for Java - which is now sold by Actuate as e.Spreadsheet. I left in 2002, but AFAIK they still maintain the Java Applet which is probably the best example of an Excel like UI in the browser (I have no interest in the product any more - in fact we compete to some extent with e.Spreadsheet and intend to have a better answer with a Silverlight control in the future). I did not mention it by name in my original answer because it is a Java product - not a .NET product - but it is a potential answer even for an ASP.NET web site. Lloyd Cotten correctly comments that Google Docs is an example of a spreadsheet built with HTML / JavaScript. Lloyd says Google Docs ""definitely 'feels right' in its similarity to Excel"". While I respect Lloyd's opinion, in my experience Google Docs does not 'feel right'. Perhaps this is because I'm a spreadsheet guy. I do know that we talk to potential customers almost every day who are trying to solve the problem of the OP, and they have all looked and cannot find one they are happy with - but of course they would not be calling us if they had so we are dealing with a biased sample and I understand that. So I just want to clarify that there are in fact plenty of examples of HTML / JavaScript grids and spreadsheets which are usable. It's just that I don't want to have to use them because I expect certain keys to do certain things and a particular level of responsiveness which is just not there today with any of the HTML / JavaScript solutions I have tried (and I look at them regularly because my company could definitely sell such a product if it were feasible to build one that we could be proud of).

My next suggestion (having seen your updated code) is that you get a decent IDE. I just loaded it up in NetBeans and found a number of errors. In particular, the ""illegal start of expression"" is because you forgot a } in the while loop, which an IDE would have flagged immediately. After you get past ""Hello world"", Notepad just doesn't cut it anymore. I'm not going to list the corrections for every error, but keep in mind that int[], int, String[], and String are all different. You seem to be using them interchangeably (probably due to the amount of changes you've done to your code). Again, an IDE would flag all of these problems. Responding to your newest code (revision 12): You're getting closer. You seem to have used MAX_TRIES for two distinct purposes: the three numbers to enter, and the three chances for each number. While these two numbers are the same, it's better not to use the same constant for both. NUM_INPUTS and MAX_TRIES are what I would call them. And you still haven't added the missing } for the while loop. The next thing to do after fixing those would be to look at if (getNumber == false). getNumber is a String[], so this comparison is illegal. You should be getting the return value of validNumCheck into a variable, like: boolean isValidNum = validNumCheck(getNumber[0]); And also, there's no reason for getNumber to be an array. You only need one String at a time, right? ",java

How to set the final value of an Animation to the property when the Animation finishes or is canceled?,"It looks like you are trying to set value back to the initial value prior to the animation starts just after the animation finishes. This actually happens automatically if you stop the animation (or when the animation timeline finishes). Animations, in WPF, can be though of as an value overlay on top of the current value of the property. Stopping or removing an animation will remove the overlay and the prior value will now start showing through again. The original value is not lost, it is being temporarily obscured. Setting the property explicitly back to its prior value is, in general, bad practice because it can incur a memory overhead if the value was not originally set locally on the object. Also, this can introduce subtle problems later. For example, if the old value was derived from a style, the property will no longer change if the style changes. If you still feel you must extract the current value and later restore it, use ReadLocalValue() instead of GetValue(). This will return DepenencyProperty.UnsetValue if the value is not set locally. You can then conditionally call ClearValue() or SetValue() depending on whether the property initially had a local value. ",c#

"Is a ""master preferences"" class a good idea?","IMHO, I think that the answer to your first question is ""yes"" and ""no"". Preferences are commonly handled as a centralized class, in the sense that the class is a ""sink"" for many classes in the project. Trying to do it closer to the calling code means that if the same preference is later useful elsewhere, you are in trouble. In my experience, trying to put the preferences ""too close"" also results in a very inconsistent handling. That being said, it is often preferable to use multiple preference classes or ""preference set"", each supporting a module or submodule. If you look at the main components of your architecture, you will often find that the set of preferences can be logically partitioned. This reduces the mess in each preference class. More importantly, it will allow you to split your program into multiple jars in the future. Now, the ""default value"" calculators can be placed in the module but still in a global enough area.  I would also suggest not setting preferences directly as static methods, but rather using some getInstance() like  operation to obtain a shared instance of the preferences manage, and then operating on it. Depending on your semantics, you may want to lock that object for a while (e.g., while the user is editing preferences in a UI) and this is easier if you have an actual object. For your other questions, I would say that your public API should have a way of letting users change preferences, but only if you can document well enough what the results of these changes could be.  If you use a single API function to get the ""reference manager"", you can give users the possibility of providing their own ""default values calculator"". The preference manager will ask this calculator first before resorting to the one you have provided by default. ",java
Why canât I use a SqlConnection instance until the SqlDataReader is closed?,"a) When ExecuteReader returns, the data has not all been retrieved and populated in the reader, it may still be streaming back from the database. That's the whole point of the SqlDataReader because it's more efficient to do this than to load it all up front. b) You can't retrieve output parameters until after the reader has finished because of the way the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol is structured. The output parameters are not physically sent down the stream until after the result set data. c) It means none of the operations except Close are documented as being guaranteed to work. Whether they actually do work or not is irrelevant because that is an implementation detail rather than a contract, and programming against implementation details is a recipe for disaster. Why do you want to re-use the connection anyway? The connections that SqlConnection uses are pooled behind the scenes, so when you dispose one it doesn't really get rid of all the resources, it just returns the connection to the pool. This means you can use the connection for the shortest time possible, ideally within a using block, and not have to worry about this type of thing. Just create a new connection whenever you need one, and don't bother trying to re-use them as it's already happening behind the scenes. ",c#
What is the best way to store configuration variables in PHP?,"I've always gone with option #2 and just ensure that no one but the owner has ANY sort of access to it. It's the most popular method among PHP applications like Joomla, vBulletin, Gallery, and numerous others. First method is too messy to me (readability) and the third is WAY too dangerous to do. I've never thought about the Class method, so someone else can provide their input on that  one. But I guess it's fine so long as the right access is used on the class' usage. Example.. define('EXAMPLE1', ""test1""); // scenario 1 $example2 = ""test2""; // scenario 2 function DealWithUserInput($input) {    return eval($input); } Now this example of code is really dumb, but just an example. Consider what could be returned by the function depending on which scenario the user could try to use in their input. Scenario 2 would only cause an issue if you made it a global within the function. Otherwise it's out of scope and unreachable. ",php

C# Threading Patterns - is this a good idea?,"Whether or not this will ""safely"" cleanup a thread cannot be discerned from a general code sample unfortunately.  It's highly dependent upon the actual code that is executed within the thread.  There are multiple issues you must consider.  Each represents a potential bug in the code.   If the thread is currently in native code, it will not immediately respect the Thread.Abort call.  It will do all of the work it wants to do in native code and will not throw until the code returns back to managed.  Until this happens thread2 will hang. Any native resources that are not freed in a finally block will be leaked in this scenario.  All native resources should be freed in a finally block but not all code does this and it's an issue to consider. Any locks that are not freed in a finally block will remain in a lock'd state and can lead to future dead locks.   There are other issues which are slipping my mind at the moment.  But hopefully this will give you some guidance with your application.   ",c#
What are the differences between a multidimensional array and an array of arrays in C#?,"Array of arrays (jagged arrays) are faster than multi-dimensional arrays and can be used more effectively. Multidimensional arrays have nicer syntax. If you write some simple code using jagged and multidimensional arrays and then inspect the compiled assembly with an IL disassembler you will see that the storage and retrieval from jagged (or single dimensional) arrays are simple IL instructions while the same operations for multidimensional arrays are method invocations which are always slower. Consider the following methods: static void SetElementAt(int[][] array, int i, int j, int value) {     array[i][j] = value; } static void SetElementAt(int[,] array, int i, int j, int value) {     array[i, j] = value; } Their IL will be the following: .method private hidebysig static void  SetElementAt(int32[][] 'array',                                                     int32 i,                                                     int32 j,                                                     int32 'value') cil managed {   // Code size       7 (0x7)   .maxstack  8   IL_0000:  ldarg.0   IL_0001:  ldarg.1   IL_0002:  ldelem.ref   IL_0003:  ldarg.2   IL_0004:  ldarg.3   IL_0005:  stelem.i4   IL_0006:  ret } // end of method Program::SetElementAt .method private hidebysig static void  SetElementAt(int32[0...,0...] 'array',                                                     int32 i,                                                     int32 j,                                                     int32 'value') cil managed {   // Code size       10 (0xa)   .maxstack  8   IL_0000:  ldarg.0   IL_0001:  ldarg.1   IL_0002:  ldarg.2   IL_0003:  ldarg.3   IL_0004:  call       instance void int32[0...,0...]::Set(int32,                                                            int32,                                                            int32)   IL_0009:  ret } // end of method Program::SetElementAt When using jagged arrays you can easily perform such operations as row swap and row resize.

Is there a Java library to access the native Windows API?,"You could try these two, I have seen success with both. http://jawinproject.sourceforge.net   The Java/Win32 integration project   (Jawin) is a free, open source   architecture for  interoperation   between Java and components exposed   through Microsoft's Component Object   Model (COM) or through Win32 Dynamic   Link Libraries (DLLs). https://github.com/twall/jna/   JNA provides Java programs easy access   to native shared libraries (DLLs on   Windows) without writing anything but   Java codeâno JNI or native code is   required. This functionality is   comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke   and Python's ctypes. Access is dynamic   at runtime without code generation.      JNA allows you to call directly into   native functions using natural Java   method invocation. The Java call looks   just like it does in native code. Most   calls require no special handling or   configuration; no boilerplate or   generated code is required. Also read up here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface   The Java Native Interface (JNI) is a   programming framework that allows Java   code running in a Java Virtual Machine   (JVM) to call and to be called1 by   native applications (programs specific   to a hardware and operating system   platform) and libraries written in   other languages, such as C, C++ and   assembly. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Access   Java Native Access provides Java   programs easy access to native shared   libraries without using the Java   Native Interface. JNA's design aims to   provide native access in a natural way   with a minimum of effort. No   boilerplate or generated glue code is   required. ",java

How to change the star images of the RatingBar?,The short answer is it looks like it's techincally possible.  The easiest way would be to create your own RatingBar based on the RatingBar sourcecode (more elegant would be to extend the orignal RatingBar into your own).  From there you would also need to create your own RatingBar style using the original RatingBar source xml as an example (or inheriting and extending the original RatingBar style). Source is available wtih git at developer.android.com. I suspect making your own rating bar is discouraged since it goes against the consistent look and feel of the OS. ,android

Why are these Div tags not nesting properly?,"Your ListSetContainer needs to contain some non-floated content for it to hava a height/width.

Anyway to error check PHP in Dreamweaver?,"Do you mean as you type? Since PHP isn't compiled, it's not as easy to do as with a language like Java or C#.

Try these editors, which have on-the-go error checking: Eclipse PDT Zend Studio  Komodo Edit If you mean how can you setup your system so you can test PHP locally on your computer without the need to upload it to the web, you need a web server on your computer.

What's the most efficient test of whether a PHP string ends with another string?,"It depends on which sort of efficiency you care about. Your version uses more memory due to the extra copy from the use of substr.

Probably the most efficient way is to do loop char-by-char from the -sterlen(test) position till the end of the string and compare.

The base for all of those will be &lt;type 'object'&gt;. You'll have to do some testing and iteration to match the dict keys you've listed in your example. Another option would be to use isinstance on any object instance, or issubclass on the parameters, testing each against your dict keys. Some consider isinstance and its ilk to be the mark of the devil, but c'est la vie. Again, though, beware of using issubclass with ints and other such types.

C++ development on linux - where do I start?,"   What are recommended guides on creating a make file, how do I compile from this makefile (do I call g++ myself, do I use 'make'?) You build from the makefile by invoking ""make"". And inside your makefile, you compile and link using g++ and ld.   Looking at other linux software, they almost always seem to have a 'configure' file. What exactly does it do? Does it only check if the required libraries are installed or does it more than just checking requirements? It's a script usually used to set up various things based on the environment being used for building. Sometimes it's just a basic shell script, other times it invokes tools like Autoconf to discover what is available when building. The ""configure"" script is usually also a place for the user to specify various optional things to be built or excluded, like support for experimental features.   How do I link libraries, and how does this relate to my makefile or g++ parameters? In windows I would compile the library, include some header files, tell my linker what additional lib file to link, and copy a dll file. How exactly does this process work in linux? ld is the GNU linker. You can invoke it separately (which is what most makefiles will end up doing), or you can have g++ delegate to it. The options you pass to g++ and ld determine where to look for included headers, libraries to link, and how to output the result.   Recommendations for code editors? I am currently using nano and I've heard of vim and emacs, but don't know what the benefits of them are over eachother. Are there any others, and why would I consider them over any of the previous three? Note: I am not looking for an IDE.

Are there any reasons not to use Visual Studio 6 for C++?,"I wouldn't say that Visual Studio 6 should ""never"" be used for C++ development.

Microsoft's later compilers add better warnings and errors. These are useful when looking for potential security problems with your code. It's no longer supported. Newer releases of the Windows SDK don't work with Visual C++ 6, so you won't be able to use newer features in Windows without extra work. To summarise: stop using Visual C++ 6.

How to run an operation on a collection in Python and collect the results?,"List comprehensions.  In Python they look something like: a = [f(x) for x in bar] Where f(x) is some function and bar is a sequence. You can define f(x) as a partially applied function with a construct like: def foo(x):     return lambda f: f*x Which will return a function that multiplies the parameter by x.  A trivial example of this type of construct used in a list comprehension looks like: &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo (x): ...     return lambda f: f*x ...  &gt;&gt;&gt; a=[1,2,3] &gt;&gt;&gt; fn_foo = foo(5) &gt;&gt;&gt; [fn_foo (y) for y in a] [5, 10, 15] Although I don't imagine using this sort of construct in any but fairly esoteric cases.  Python is not a true functional language, so it has less scope to do clever tricks with higher order functions than (say) Haskell.  You may find applications for this type of construct, but it's not really that pythonic.  You could achieve a simple transformation with something like: &gt;&gt;&gt; y=5 &gt;&gt;&gt; a=[1,2,3] &gt;&gt;&gt; [x*y for x in a] [5, 10, 15] ",python

Can I stop 100% Width Text Boxes from extending beyond their containers?,"Actually, it's because CSS defines 100% relative to the entire width of the container, including its margins, borders, and padding; that means that the space avail. to its contents is some amount smaller than 100%, unless the container has no margins, borders, or padding.  This is counter-intuitive and widely regarded by many to be a mistake that we are now stuck with.  It effectively means that % dimensions are no good for anything other than a top level container, and even then, only if it has no margins, borders or padding. Note that the text field's margins, borders, and padding are included in the CSS size specified for it - it's the container's which throw things off. I have tolerably worked around it by using 98%, but that is a less than perfect solution, since the input fields tend to fall further short as the container gets larger.

You could eventually break the spec and create a static attribute somewhere (maybe in the MDB itself) but this would certainly be not portable, neither scalable. My suggestion is to enable caching at the JPA level (see your persistence provider of preference for details), so you can lookup whatever data you need very fast (really fast).

What are the advantages of delegates?,"They're a great way of encapsulating a piece of code. For instance, when you attach an event handler to the button, that handler is a delegate. The button doesn't need to know what it does, just how to call it at the right time. Another example is LINQ - filtering, projecting etc all require the same kind of template code; all that changes is the logic to represent the filter, the projection etc. With lambda expressions in C# 3 (which are converted into delegates or expression trees) this makes it really simple: var namesOfAdults = people.Where(person =&gt; person.Age &gt;= 18)                           .Select(person =&gt; person.Name); (That can also be represented as a query expression, but let's not stray too far from delegates.) Another way of thinking of a delegate is as a single-method interface type. For example, the EventHandler delegate type is a bit like: public interface IEventHandler {     void Invoke(object sender, EventArgs e) } But the delegate support in the framework allows delegates to be chained together, invoked asynchronously, used as event handlers etc. For more on delegates and events, see my article on the topic. Its focus is events, but it covers delegates too. ",c#

Is it possible to have Castor marshal/unmarshal an EnumMap?,"One of the big problems is that Enums can't really be serialized and restored, at least not in Java 1.5.

From the castor web page :   While you can always use your own   custom FieldHandler for handling   type-safe enumeration classes, Castor   does have a built-in approach to   dealing with these types of classes.   If the type-safe enum class has a   public static  valueOf(String)   method Castor will call that method so   that the proper instance of the   enumeration is returned. Note: You'll   also need to disable the default   constructor check in the mapping file   (see section 7.4 above to see more on   this). if that does not work you have to write your own field handler.

Is using a Mutex to prevent multiple instances of the same program from running safe?,"In general yes this will work.  However the devil is in the details. Firstly you want to close the mutex in a finally block.  Otherwise your process could abruptly terminate and leave it in a signaled state, like an exception.  That would make it so that future process instances would not be able to start up.   Unfortunately though, even with a finally block you must deal with the potential that a process will be terminated without freeing up the mutex.  This can happen for instance if a user kills the process through TaskManager.  There is a race condition in your code that would allow for a second process to get an AbandonedMutexException in the WaitOne call.  You'll need a recovery strategy for this.   I encourage you to read up on the details of the Mutex class.  Using it is not always simple. Expanding upon the race condition possibility: The following sequence of events can occur which would cause a second instance of the application to throw: Normal process startup. Second process starts up and aquires a handle to the mutex but is switched out before the WaitOne call. Process #1 is abruptly terminated.  The mutex is not destroyed because process #2 has a handle.  It is instead set to an abandoned state. The second process starts running again and gets an AbanonedMutexException. ",c#
How can I implement an algorithm for multicore in Java?,"This isn't necessarily true. Depending on the algorithm, it often makes sense to split it into multiple threads even if there is only a single core available.  If there is any waiting on sockets, IO, etc, you can get benefits from this.  If there are 2 processes, the ""other"" process may not be using 100% of the other core, so threading can help here.  Trust your OS in this case to handle it correctly. You can always check the processor count with Runtime.availableProcessors() to determine how to split it into separate threads.  Alternatively, you can use a threadpool, which should scale correctly with more processors. In general, though, I would design your algorithm to use more than one processor if the algorithm makes sense to parallelize.  Most systems will have more cores/processors available, and you can always tweak your implementation later if you find it needs it.  If the process is long running, the overhead of generating the thread will be worth it - if it's already fast, it may be more worthwhile looking at other places to optimize. ",java

If you look at the Javadoc, you'll see that InputStream an abstract class.  Subclasses that extend InputStream are expected to override the close() method (should it be needed).  Clearly the InputStream subclass that you're using does something in the close method. ",java

Hence, we can do away with J2ME, which was designed for ancient Nokias, and enjoy the standard Java on a smart doorknob (or a smartphone).

jQuery: Adding context to a selector is much faster than refining your selector?,"   adding context to the selector is much   faster than refining your selector This is true in the general case. With respect to your specific examples however it is not necessarily true for jQuery &lt;= 1.2.6. Up to and including jQuery 1.2.6 the selector engine worked in a ""top down"" (or ""left to right"") manner. Meaning that both your examples would operate like this (roughly): var root = document.getElementById('bar'); return root.getElementsByTagName('li'); jQuery 1.3.x  (ie, Sizzle, which jQuery embeds) introduced a ""bottom up"" (or ""right to left"") approach to querying the DOM. So $('#bar li') now becomes (roughly): var results = []; var elements = document.getElementsByTagName('li'); for(var i=0; i &lt; elements.length; i++) {     var element = elements[i];     var parent = element.parentNode;     while(parent) {         if(parent.id == 'bar') {             results.push(element)             break;         }         parent = parent.parentNode;     } } return results There are benefits and downsides to both approaches. You found one of the downsides. Edit: just found out from this discussion that Sizzle trunk now makes a special exemption of selectors where #id is first. It uses that as the root context, speeding things up a bit. This should diminish if not eliminate the speed differences you are seeing. ",jquery

How do I make Weblogic 8.1 serve static content?,"You might want to take a look here and here: Here's the short version of what BEA says:   Web Applications      HTTP and Web Applications are deployed   according to the Servlet 2.3   specification from Sun Microsystems,   which describes the use of Web   Applications as a standardized way of   grouping together the components of a   Web-based application.

Basically, what I had to do get this type of thing to work was to configure my set of static pages as an application, and deploy it as such. In whatever directory or .war you deploy, you'll need a WEB-INF directory and probably a web.xml file within that points at your static files.

What is the most efficient way to convert an int to a String?,"Look at the source code of the JRE and you'll probably see the difference. Or none.

For the other cases use the Integer.toString(int foo, int radix). The concat solution first transforms the int value into a String and later concatenates with the empty String. This obviously is the most expensive case. ",java

Is there any preferable way to get user/group information from an Active Directory domain in Python?,"AD's LDAP interface has quite a few 'quirks' that make it more difficult to use than it might appear on the surface, and it tends to lag significantly behind on features.

There's a lot of weirdness in terms of having to be bound as a certain user just to do simple searches that a normal LDAP server would let you do as anonymous. Also, at least as of a year ago, when I worked on this, python-ldap was the only Python LDAP implementation to support anywhere close to the full feature set, since it's built on top of OpenLDAP, However, OpenLDAP is rather difficult to build on Windows (and in general), so most builds will be missing one or more features.  Although you're not doing authentication, a lack of SASL/Kerberos support (which was missing at the time I used it) might make things complicated for you. If you have something that works, and only need to run it on Windows, I would really recommend sticking to it; using AD via LDAP can turn into a big project. ",python

In general, if you will be working only with the type itself you can accept a type parameter.  If you want to do anything with an instance of the type, use a generic. Another reason to use a generic is if you want to apply constraints to the type.  For example, you can require the type to implement one or several interfaces, inherit another type, be a reference type or value type, have a default constructor, or some combination of the above.  The compiler will enforce this so you can't build code that doesn't comply with your requirements. ",c#
Why is there a special new and delete for arrays?,"Objects created with new[] must use delete[].  Using delete is undefined on arrays. With malloc and free you have a more simple situation.  There is only 1 function that frees the data you allocate, there is no concept of a destructor being called either.  The confusion just comes in because delete[] and delete look similar.  Actually they are 2 completely different functions. Using delete won't call the correct function to delete the memory. It should call delete[](void*) but instead it calls delete(void*).  For this reason you can't rely on using delete for memory allocated with new[] See this C++ FAQ   [16.13] Can I drop the [] when   deleteing array of some built-in type   (char, int, etc)?      No!      Sometimes programmers think that the   [] in the delete[] p only exists so   the compiler will call the appropriate   destructors for all elements in the   array. Because of this reasoning, they   assume that an array of some built-in   type such as char or int can be   deleted without the []. E.g., they   assume the following is valid code: void userCode(int n)  {     char* p = new char[n];     ...     delete p; // â ERROR! Should be delete[] p ! }      But the above code is wrong, and it   can cause a disaster at runtime. In   particular, the code that's called for   delete p is operator delete(void*),   but the code that's called for   delete[] p is operator   delete[](void*). The default behavior   for the latter is to call the former,   but users are allowed to replace the   latter with a different behavior (in   which case they would normally also   replace the corresponding new code in   operator new[](size_t)). If they   replaced the delete[] code so it   wasn't compatible with the delete   code, and you called the wrong one   (i.e., if you said delete p rather   than delete[] p), you could end up   with a disaster at runtime. Why does delete[] exist in the first place? Whether you do x or y:  char * x = new char[100];   char * y = new char; Both are stored in char * typed variables.  I think the reason for the decision of delete, and delete[] goes along with a long list of decisions that are in favor of efficiency in C++.  It is so that there is no enforced price to do a lookup of how much needs to be deleted for a normal delete operation.  Having 2 new and new[] seems only logical to have delete and delete[] anyway for symmetry.  ",c++

I like just raising an EventArgs.Empty and then have the code catching the event explicit querying the object that raised the event for the data.

This makes it easier to just read what you need, but ofcourse - you could find yourself in a situation where those properties changed between the event raised and you reading the properties. ",c#
Change the alpha value of a BufferedImage?,"I'm 99% sure the methods that claim to deal with an ""RGB"" value packed into an int actually deal with ARGB.

How do you add a directory of java classes to a project?,"It sounds like you have tried to add the two packages to your classpath seperately - and at the wrong level.  If you are pointing at a folder, you have to point to the ""root"" folder of the package hierarchy - ie in this case the folder which is the parent of ""org"" Then from there it will look down the package/folder hierarchy org/syntax/jedit to find your classes. So if your files are in the directory ""c:\mylib\src\main\java\org\syntax\jedit"" then you need to point the compiler folder at ""c:\mylib\src\main\java"". That should then find all the classes.

How do I include .class files in my project in Eclipse? (Java),"Other people have now given better answers.  This ""answer"" was mainly to get information from the OP because the original question didn't really tell us, fully, what had been tried.  There are now two answers that truly answer the question in a long-term way. My original answer is left below for context. Did you copy it to the bin folder within Eclipse or outside Eclipse?  If you did this outside Eclipse then you have to right click on the ""bin"" folder and select ""refresh"" for Eclipse to see the new file. A *.class file in the appropriate folder (depending on its package) under the bin directory should do it. ",java

Python: How do you login to a page and view the resulting page in a browser?,"First off, when doing cookie-based authentication, you need to have a CookieJar to store your cookies in, much in the same way that your browser stores its cookies a place where it can find them again. After opening a login-page through python, and saving the cookie from a successful login, you should use the MozillaCookieJar to pass the python created cookies to a format a firefox browser can parse. Firefox 3.x no longer uses the cookie format that MozillaCookieJar produces, and I have not been able to find viable alternatives. If all you need to do is to retrieve specific (in advance known format formatted) data, then I suggest you keep all your HTTP interactions within python. It is much easier, and you don't have to rely on specific browsers being available. If it is absolutely necessary to show stuff in a browser, you could render the so-called 'hidden' page through urllib2 (which incidentally integrates very nicely with cookielib), save the html to a temporary file and pass this to the webbrowser.open which will then render that specific page. Further redirects are not possible. ",python
C# Nested Try Catch statements or methods?,"Depends on what you are trying to do, but in most cases, nested try/catches are a sign of an over-complex function (or of a programmer who doesn't quite know how exceptions work!).

c++ class why need main?,"   but I don't need (nor want) a main() in the class implementation. The function main is your entry-point. That is where execution begins. You need to have one and only one such function.   But compiler give me ""undefined reference to main"" for animal.cpp, but I don't need a main there, or do I need it? Now, your problem looks like you have not linked the compiled forms of app.cpp and animal.cpp.    I'm not so strong in Makefiles, I used something like g++ animal.h -o animal and g++ animal.cpp but it gives me the error above You don't compile headers.  So don't use: g++ animal.h When you compiled the animal.cpp separately, g++ created an object file. You will also need to compile the app.cpp because you do need the main. Once you compile the app.cpp file you will have to link it with the animal object file created earlier. But if these did not get linked in,  specially, the file containing the main function you will hit the error you are getting now. However, g++ takes care of what I have described above. Try something like this: g++ animal.cpp app.cpp -o test This will create an executable called test and you can run your application using: ./test ",c++

Specifying Tab-Width?,"I believe this blog post should help you out:   Here's a solution, it's not neat since it has to be done for every instance of a tab, but it makes the tabs take up less space and preserves the formatting for copying out of the browser (obviously replace ""A SINGLE TAB HERE"" with a real tab, this blog software automatically removes tabs from entries it seems): &lt;span style=""display:none""&gt;A SINGLE TAB HERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=""margin-left:YOUR NEW TAB WIDTH""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   Basically, replace every instance of a tab in your code with that code snippet (after choosing a suitable width, you could do it in a stylesheet pretty easily).

Is there a way to manually register a user with a py-transport server-side?," Go through once for each transport and register yourself.  Capture the XMPP packets.  Dump the transport registration data from your current system into a csv file, xml file, or something else you can know the structure. Write a script using jabberpy, xmpppy, pyxmpp, or whatever, and emulate each of your users registering with the transports. One issue is you may have to be connected to the Internet for the transports to come online.  Then you're going live with someone else's account.  If you can't get their current password data for your jabber server, set it all to a default and then migrate it back after your transport registration. ",python
How do I create a D-Bus service that dynamically creates multiple objects?,"1) Mostly yes, I would only change one thing in the connect method as I explain in 2).  2) D-Bus connections are not persistent, everything is done with request/response messages, no connection state is stored unless you implement this in third objects as you do with your flickerObject. The d-bus objects in python bindings are mostly proxies that abstract the remote objects as if you were ""connected"" to them, but what it really does is to build messages based on the information you give to D-Bus object instantiation (object path, interface and so). So the service cannot know when the client is done if client doesn't announce it with other explicit call. To handle unexpected client finalization you can create a D-Bus object in the client and send the object path to the service when connecting, change your connect method to accept also an ObjectPath parameter. The service can listen to NameOwnerChanged signal to know if a client has died. To create the individual object you only have to instantiate an object in the same service as you do with your ""/Connection"", but you have to be sure that you are using an unexisting name. You could have a ""/Connection/Manager"", and various ""/Connection/1"", ""/Connection/2""... 3) If you need to store the connection state, you have to do something like that. ",python

Would you consider Terracotta to be a mature product?,"Just an FYI, The release you refer to - 3.0.0-stable0 - is the first milestone release of the 3.0 line.  This is the current, in progress version that has not yet been released.  The current stable release line is 2.7 (current version: 2.7.3). If you are looking for a stable, mature product, you should base your opinions on 2.7.x, not 3.0.  The practice is quite commonplace to have a ""bleeding edge"" product and a stable release product.  It may be the terminology that has misled you.  For more information on release naming in use by Terracotta, please have a look at the Buildology page. Regarding version numbers, this is regrettable, but necessary.  In order for the product to improve, changes to the network protocol and underlying storage format happen from time to time.  When these changes occur, the product is incompatible with prior versions.  Rather than promise something that is not possible (backward compatibility) the Terracotta team has chosen instead to prohibit different versions from talking to one another. In the 3.0 line forward, the notion of a Stable Terracotta API has been introduced, which will lay the groundwork for some amount of compatibility between dot releases, e.g. 3.0.0 -> 3.0.1. HTH.

how do you set a max-age for javascript/css?,"Sounds like it's talking about HTTP headers. Basically you'll need to add a couple of HTTP headers to be sent with your Javascript and CSS files (and images too, would be a good idea), looking something like this: Cache-Control: max-age=86400 Expires: Sat, 28 Mar 2009 16:00:00 GMT The first one gives the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a browser will keep the content (the JS or CSS file) before downloading it again from the server; the second one gives the date and time after which the browser should redownload the content. Yes, these are two ways of saying the same thing, but the Cache-Control header is a little newer and I'm not sure if it's universally supported yet; there's really no harm in specifying both. (Cache-Control takes precedence over Expires if there is a conflict.) As for how you actually configure your server to send these headers: it depends on which web server you're running. If you're using Apache, look at mod_expires. ",javascript

How to Implement multi language in PHP application?,"I would use locale-specific files with constants, eg: locale_en.php: define('GREETING', ""Welcome to Widgets Inc'); and locale_de.php: define('GREETING', 'Wir begruessen Sie zu Widgets Inc'); in your setup you detect the locale and do: if ($locale == 'en') {   require 'locale_en.php'; } else if ($locale == 'de') {   require 'locale_de.php'; } This gives you the benefit of constants and makes localization reasonably transparent to your application in that you don't have to do if ($locale ... all over the place. If anything is locale-specific, just put it in the locale files. If you want to add a locale file just copy an existing one and change all the references rather than trawling your codebase for them. You can also put code in these files like correctly formatting numbers and dates for these locales (including the right names in each language but also the use of commas, quotes, periods and so on), currency conversions and displays, etc. ",php

Do you follow any guidelines (java) in packaging?,"Packaging is normally about release management, and the general guidelines are: consistency: when you are releasing into integration, pre-production or production environment several deliveries, you want them organized (or ""packaged"") exactly the same way small number of files: when you have to copy a set of files from one environment to another, you want to copy as many as possible, if their number is reasonable (10-20 max per component to deliver), you can just copy them (even if those files are important in size) So you want to define a common structure for each delivery like: aDelivery/     lib // all jar, ear, war, ...     bin // all scripts used to launch your application: sh, bat, ant files, ...     config // all properties files, config files     src // all sources zipped into jars     docs // javadoc zipped      ... Plus, all those common directory structures should be stored into one common repository (a VCS, or a maven repo, or...), in order to be queried, without having to rebuilt them every time you need them (you do not need that if you have only one or two delivery components, but when you have 40 to 60 of them... a full rebuilt is out of the question).

Can Java annotations be unit tested?,"You can't test them directly since, as you noted, there's nothing there to test. You could prove some things, though: Objects with annotations in the code have any expected annotations at runtime Default values have been initialized The annotations bind to the things you expect them to When you unit test, one of the things you can prove is that your implementation conforms to the interface. So if an annotation implies certain behavior or properties (e.g. Serializable things really should be serializable), you would want to represent this in your tests, too. ",java

This call copies texture data and that data is managed by OpenGL.  You can delete, resize, change your original texture array all you want and it won't make a different to the texture you specified to OpenGL. Edit: C/C++ deals with only 1 dimensional arrays.  The fact that you can do texture[a][b] is hidden and converted by the compiler at compile time.  The compiler must know the number of columns and will do texture[a*cols + b]. Use a class to hide the allocation, access to the texture. For academic purposes, if you really want dynamic multi dimensional arrays the following should work: int rows = 16, cols = 16; char * storage = new char[rows * cols]; char ** accessor2D = new char *[rows]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++) {     accessor2D[i] = storage + i*cols; } accessor2D[5][5] = 2; assert(storage[5*cols + 5] == accessor2D[5][5]); delete [] accessor2D; delete [] storage; Notice that in all the cases I'm using 1D arrays.  They are just arrays of pointers, and array of pointers to pointers.  There's memory overhead to this.  Also this is done for 2D array without colour components.  For 3D dereferencing this gets really messy.  Don't use this in your code. ",c++

Where to stop/destroy threads in Android Service class?,"Addendum: The Android framework provides many helpers for one-off work, background work, etc, which may be preferable over trying to roll your own thread in many instances. As mentioned in a below post, AsyncTask is a good starting point to look into. I encourage readers to look into the framework provisions first before even beginning to think about doing their own threading. There are several problems in the code sample you posted I will address in order: 1) Thread.stop() has been deprecated for quite some time now, as it can leave dependent variables in inconsistent states in some circumstances. See this Sun answer page for more details (Edit: that link is now dead, see this page for why not to use Thread.stop()). A preferred method of stopping and starting a thread is as follows (assuming your thread will run somewhat indefinitely): private volatile Thread runner; public synchronized void startThread(){   if(runner == null){     runner = new Thread(this);     runner.start();   } } public synchronized void stopThread(){   if(runner != null){     Thread moribund = runner;     runner = null;     moribund.interrupt();   } } public void run(){   while(Thread.currentThread() == runner){     //do stuff which can be interrupted if necessary   } } This is just one example of how to stop a thread, but the takeaway is that you are responsible for exiting a thread just as you would any other method. Maintain a method of cross thread communcation (in this case a volatile variable, could also be through a mutex, etc) and within your thread logic, use that method of communication to check if you should early exit, cleanup, etc. 2) Your measurements list is accessed by multiple threads (the event thread and your user thread) at the same time without any synchronization. It looks like you don't have to roll your own synchronization, you can use a BlockingQueue. 3) You are creating a new Socket every iteration of your sending Thread. This is a rather heavyweight operation, and only really make sense if you expect measurements to be extremely infrequent (say one an hour or less). Either you want a persistent socket that is not recreated every loop of the thread, or you want a one shot runnable you can 'fire and forget' which creates a socket, sends all relevant data, and finishes. (A quick note about using a persistent Socket, socket methods which block, such as reading, cannot be interrupted by Thread.interrupt(), and so when you want to stop the thread, you must close the socket as well as calling interrupt) 4) There is little point in throwing your own exceptions from within a Thread unless you expect to catch it somewhere else. A better solution is to log the error and if it is irrecoverable, stop the thread. A thread can stop itself with code like (in the same context as above): public void run(){     while(Thread.currentThread() == runner){       //do stuff which can be interrupted if necessary       if(/*fatal error*/){         stopThread();         return; //optional in this case since the loop will exit anyways       }     }   } Finally, if you want to be sure a thread exits with the rest of your application, no matter what, a good technique is to call Thread.setDaemon(true) after creation and before you start the thread. This flags the thread as a daemon thread, meaning the VM will ensure that it is automatically destroyed if there are no non-daemon threads running (such as if your app quits). Obeying best practices with regards to Threads should ensure that your app doesn't hang or slow down the phone, though they can be quite complex :) ",java

How do I pass a Linq query to a method?,"You'll need to either use a normal type for the projection, or make the method you're passing it to generic as well (which will mean you can't do as much with it). What exactly are you trying to do? If you need to use the X and Y values from the method, you'll definitely need to create a normal type. (There are horribly hacky ways of avoiding it, but they're not a good idea.) Note: some other answers are currently talking about IQueryable&lt;T&gt;, but there's no indication that you're using anything more than LINQ to Objects, in which case it'll be an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; instead - but the T is currently an anonymous type. That's the bit you'll need to work on if you want to use the individual values within each item. If you're not using LINQ to Objects, please clarify the question and I'll edit this answer. For example, taking your current query (which is slightly broken, as you can't use two projection initializers twice with the same name X).

So while it's widely known how to program a scientific calculation program to achieve great performance, it is completely different thing to write a mail user agent/word processor that can be good at concurrency. Also, most of the current OS's were being designed with a single processor in mind, and they may not be fully prepared for multicore processors. The benefit of LLVM with respect to concurrency is that you have an intermediate output, and if in the future there are advances in concurrency, then by updating your interpreter you instantly gain those benefits in all LLVM-compiled programs.  This is not so easy if you had compiled to a standalone executable. So LLVM doesn't solve the concurrency problem per se but it leaves an open door for future enhancements. Sure there are more possible advances for the hardware like quantum computers, genetics computers, etc. But we have to wait for them to become a reality. ",python

Java Keylistener without window being open?,"This might be out of the scope of a Java applet. In fact, global keyboard hooks are definitely out of the scope of simply using Java, but I can help you get moving in the right direction. However, you have some hope. I'll point you into the direction of JNI (Java Native Interface), which will allow you to use native libraries. Now, since you want to stay in the Java world, I suggest not directly using JNI because you'll have to write some confusing native code (typically C, C++). There are several wrappers for JNI that allow you to use the functions but the native implementations are abstracted away, but a lot of these cost money. So the best solution for you, I think, is JNA (Java Native Access). This allows you to directly call native libraries from within Java. (NOTE: The implementation not will be cross platform. You have to make separate implementations for Windows, Linux, etc.) There's a good example for Windows keyboard hooks in the examples on the project website. As for opening it's own window not in a webpage, do you want the applet to not run within the browser but in its own separate process, or just be in a separate window and still rely on the browser window being open? If you want to simply launch a new window and still require the browser to be open, then here's a good example: final Frame window = new Frame(""This is the Frame's Title Bar!""); window.add(new Label(""This is the Frame."")); window.setSize(300,200); window.setVisible(true); window.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter(){     public void windowClosing(WindowEvent we){         window.dispose();     } }); If you want the applet to spawn a new process and run without the need of the browser, look into JavaFX.

"Create if an entry doesn't exist, otherwise update?","Look up REPLACE in the MySQL manual.   REPLACE works exactly like INSERT,   except that if an old row in the table   has the same value as a new row for a   PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index, the old   row is deleted before the new row is   inserted. See Section 12.2.5, âINSERT   Syntaxâ.      REPLACE is a MySQL extension to the   SQL standard. It either inserts, or   deletes and inserts. For another MySQL   extension to standard SQL â that   either inserts or updates â see   Section 12.2.5.3, âINSERT ... ON   DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Syntaxâ. If you have the following INSERT query: INSERT INTO table (id, field1, field2) VALUES (1, 23, 24) This is the REPLACE query you should run: REPLACE INTO table (id, field1, field2) VALUES (1, 23, 24) ",php

Remember, in SWT, each Color object allocates native resources, which is why you have to dispose() it.  This means each time you allocate and dispose a Color object, you have to transition from the JVM to native code and back. Can you cache your Color instances while in the 300x300 pixel loop and then dispose of the objects after your loop?  You'd need a somewhat intelligent cache that only holds a maximum of so many objects, and after that will dispose of some of its entries, but this should speed things up greatly. ",java

Is there an un-buffered I/O in Windows system?,"streams are about as low level as you can get.. and they can be unbuffered.  int setvbuf(    FILE *stream,    char *buffer,    int mode,    size_t size  ); example   setvbuf(stdout, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0); //unbuffered stdout here is an extract from the vc2008 help document. The setvbuf function allows the program to control both buffering and buffer size for stream. stream must refer to an open file that has not undergone an I/O operation since it was opened. The array pointed to by buffer is used as the buffer, unless it is NULL, in which case setvbuf uses an automatically allocated buffer of length size/2 * 2 bytes.  The mode must be _IOFBF , _IOLBF , or _IONBF. If mode is _IOFBF or _IOLBF, then size is used as the size of the buffer. If mode is _IONBF, the stream is unbuffered and size and buffer are ignored. Values for mode and their meanings are:  _IOFBF Full buffering; that is, buffer is used as the buffer and size is used as the size of the buffer. If buffer is NULL, an automatically allocated buffer size bytes long is used.  _IOLBF For some systems, this provides line buffering. However, for Win32, the behavior is the same as _IOFBF - Full Buffering.  _IONBF No buffer is used, regardless of buffer or size.  ",c++

Why can't I leverage 4GB of RAM in my computer to process less than 2GB of information in C#?,"Yes, String.Split creates a new String object for each ""piece"" - that's what it's meant to do. Now, bear in mind that strings in .NET are Unicode (UTF-16 really), and with the object overhead the cost of a string in bytes is approximately 20 + 2*n where n is the number of characters. That means if you've got a lot of small strings, it'll take a lot of memory compared with the size of text data involved. For example, an 80 character line split into 10 x 8 character strings will take 80 bytes in the file, but 10 * (20 + 2*8) = 360 bytes in memory - a 4.5x blow-up! I doubt that this is a GC problem - and I'd advise you to remove extra statements setting variables to null when it's not necessary - just a problem of having too much data. What I would suggest is that you read the file line-by-line (using TextReader.ReadLine() instead of TextReader.ReadToEnd()). Clearly having the whole file in memory if you don't need to is wasteful.

What is your experience with ARM Jazelle?,"I worked for a big wireless handset maker.  Our team was porting J2ME to the ARM-based handsets.  We had 2 guys working on using Jazelle; no OS, just on raw ARM9 silicon.  Sadly, it stayed in research because the JIT got the performance we needed without having to pay the license fees for Jazelle. If you accept the rule-of-thumb that running the Hotspot JVM without JIT runs at 1/10th of compiled C.  Then, JIT returns 50% of what you lost and Jazelle returns 60% of what you lost.  These are very rough estimates.  It all depends on the kind of code that is running.  Jazelle had slightly better performance for our test cases because it handled more situations than the JIT.  Whereas the JIT went compiled-C-fast in a handful of cases.  The previous poster seems to misunderstand Jazelle.  Jazelle causes a trap-like action for a  Java bytecode.  The user must supply code snippets to handle each bytecode.  Without such snippets and the lookup table, you are going to get the unimplemented exception. ",java

Filtering an IEnumerable by type (LINQy): As Jon Skeet pointed out, you should use OfType extension method to filter a sequence easily (assuming you got LINQ): var filteredSequence = sequence.OfType&lt;TargetType&gt;(); Casting an IEnumerable to type (LINQy): If you want to try casting each element to the target type (as opposed to filtering by type), you can use the Cast extension method: var castedSequence = sequence.Cast&lt;TargetType&gt;(); ",c#
Is there any open source program that use the inpout.dll?,"These sites, http://www.lvr.com/parport.htm and http://lcdinterfacing.googlepages.com/, have some VB code for testing and using inpout.dll in real world scenarios, which you could probably tailor to C++. This site, has a C++ tutorial on using it. (* Strange, if you click on that link, you get a 404 but, if you then just hit ENTER in the address bar, it works - the address is: http://logix4u.net/Legacy_Ports/Parallel_Port/A_tutorial_on_Parallel_port_Interfacing.html if you want to cut and paste - it appears to be something to do with underscore/%5F translation *). Note the comments that, if you're developing for the more secure Windows platforms (anything after Win98, I guess), you should be using the inpout32 variant. Those links are good if you're just looking for source to be able to write your own. If, by open source, you actually meant 'speech-free', I haven't been able to find any (SourceForge, which is my go-to place for FOSS, returns zero hits). ",c++

Where can I find a nice .NET Tab Control for free?,"I don't know of any open source or free tab controls, but I wonder why you don't just use the framework's tab control.  Is there something you are trying to do that the Forms.TabControl doesn't do? ",c#
Should a business object collection inherit from Collection<T> when it doesn't extend it?,"If it's OK for your business object to provide usual collection methods to the world, then it's quite OK to inherit from Collection&lt;T&gt;. And as I guess, in fact you add something to it - you specify T. Udate: According to author's comments, publishing of all collection methods would make object editable which is not acceptable. So instead of inheriting he would make private field and make the class enumerable.  ",c#
How to execute an arbitrary shell script and pass multiple variables via Python?,"See http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#using-the-subprocess-module   args should be a string, or a sequence   of program arguments. The program to   execute is normally the first item in   the args sequence or the string if a   string is given, but can be explicitly   set by using the executable argument. So, your call can look like this p = subprocess.Popen( args=[""script.sh"", ""-p"", p_opt, ""-v"", v_opt, arg1, arg2] ) You've put arbitrary Python values into the args of subprocess.Popen. ",python
Compromised interoperability in .NET?,"I expect there are lots of things, but mostly in corner cases if you're talking about the major managed languages (C#, VB, and soon F#).  Other cases where F# currently interacts poorly with C# is when there method overloads that take both Action and Func (the C# overload resolution works differently than F#, so F# calls to such an API may be more verbose); 'params' argument arrays (especially when trying to tak advantage of 'array covariance', which is a feature of C# but not F#); there are some issues regarding subclassing or implementing interfaces, combined with accessibility (e.g. public versus internal), where sometimes you cannot derive an F# class from a C# one... Many of these issues are simply either 'bugs' in the F# CTP compiler or 'design issues' with the F# language spec that may be changed before the final release of F#. I don't know the dusty corners of the CLR well enough, but I bet that there are places where C# and VB fails to mesh.  And there are features of the CLR that none of the major languages use, so I expect there's ways to create valid IL that may cause problems with some interop. Overall I think all this stuff is minor, and in the case of F#, a bit of it will be 'fixed' before the final release.  But I will be curious to see what other things people call out, as it could be useful feedback for the managed language teams at MS. ",c#
Looking for a better alternative to PIL for basic image file I/O and processing in Python?,"Not really. PIL is pretty much what everybody uses. I've never had any difficulties with it myself.

How to clone ArrayList and also clone its contents?,"You will need to iterate on the items, and clone them one by one, putting the clones in your result array as you go. public static List&lt;Dog&gt; cloneList(List&lt;Dog&gt; list) {     List&lt;Dog&gt; clone = new ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt;(list.size());     for (Dog item : list) clone.add(item.clone());     return clone; } For that to work, obviously, you will have to get your Dog object to implement the Cloneable interface, and the clone() method.

How to transition from embedded software development to web development?,"A good next step might be to go the iPhone developer route as you most likely have the experience dealing with client curiosities (memory leaks, limited cpu, etc).  The iPhone/iPod Touch also benefits from having a fairly powerful webkit based browser which can run most AJAX you can write and can interface with a server side component. To keep things cheap, you could run a java stack on an EC2 server or some other VPS that can act as the server side portion of your app. It's a $99 investment for the developer license and $5 a month for a cheap VPS for dev, but the payoff can be high if the wind is blowing in the right direction and there's a full moon when you launch your app(s). (oh, and cheap addictive games can bring in a decent amount of money from the long tail, though who knows how long this will hold with serious games being launched on the iPhone by major players like EA) ",java

Does the Python library httplib2 cache URIs with GET strings?,"httplib2 uses the full URI for the cache key, so in this case each of the URLs you have in your example will be cached separately by the client. For the chapter and verse from the __init__.py file for httplib2, if you would like proof, have a look at call to the cache on around line 1000: cachekey = defrag_uri cached_value = self.cache.get(cachekey) The defrag_uri is defined by the function urlnorm (line 170ish) and includes the scheme, authority, path, and query. Of course, as you know, the server may interpret the definition of ""resource"" quite differently and, so, may still return cached content. Since it sounds like you're controlling the server in this case, you have full control there, so no issues. Either way, on the client side, there would be no client-cached values used for the first call to each of the 3 URLs in your examples. ",python

Why doesn't this for-each loop work?,"the int is a primitive type in the system, so you're actually getting a copy of the value of the cell in the array, rather than a reference to that cell in the array that you can assign into.... Let me try and explain this. If you had an array of Xs, where X is a class that has data members, you would be getting a reference to a different cell in each iteration, and would be able to change its state by calling functions on it (e.g., setValue). When you have ints it's a different story, your int is not a reference, it is an actual value on the stack since it's a primitive type, so in each iteration, the for copies a value from the array into the i. You then update your i, but that has no effect on the array. ",ios
Where does <_o3a_p> come from on a webpage?,"I can't find the cause, but the Google results show it happening on non-Russian pages too.

Also, on each page I looked at these were written as HTML tags, but were rendered as text by Firefox and Safari.  Maybe a naÃ¯ve editor is using these as tags for its own use, not realising that browsers will show the tag instead of ignoring them like normal unknown tags. ",ios
Removing specific items from Django's cache?,"I haven't done a lot of caching with Django, but I think what you want here are signals.
